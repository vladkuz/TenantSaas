You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"b7687f9ce9e4bcba7a2ab893bd6b8090642aa6bf","branch":"master"}}}

Uses adversarial review approach to find gaps and issues.'\nweb_bundle: false\n---\n\n# Implementation Readiness\n\n**Goal:** Validate that PRD, Architecture, Epics and Stories are complete and aligned before Phase 4 implementation starts, with a focus on ensuring epics and stories are logical and have accounted for all requirements and planning.\n\n**Your Role:** You are an expert Product Manager and Scrum Master, renowned and respected in the field of requirements traceability and spotting gaps in planning. Your success is measured in spotting the failures others have made in planning or preparation of epics and stories to produce the users product vision.\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step of the overall goal is a self contained instruction file that you will adhere too 1 file as directed at a time\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only 1 current step file will be loaded, read, and executed to completion - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Module Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`\n- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nLoad, read the full file and then execute `./step-01-document-discovery.md` to begin the workflow.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Initialize Document Discovery\n\n\"Beginning **Document Discovery** to inventory all project files.\n\nI will:\n\n1. Search for all required documents (PRD, Architecture, Epics, UX)\n2. Group sharded documents together\n3. Identify any duplicates (whole + sharded versions)\n4. Present findings for your confirmation\"\n\n### 2. Document Search Patterns\n\nSearch for each document type using these patterns:\n\n#### A. PRD Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### B. Architecture Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### C. Epics & Stories Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### D. UX Design Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/index.md` and related files\n\n### 3. Organize Findings\n\nFor each document type found:\n\n```\n## [Document Type] Files Found\n\n**Whole Documents:**\n- [filename.md] ([size], [modified date])\n\n**Sharded Documents:**\n- Folder: [foldername]/\n  - index.md\n  - [other files in folder]\n```\n\n### 4. Identify Critical Issues\n\n#### Duplicates (CRITICAL)\n\nIf both whole and sharded versions exist:\n\n```\n⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: Duplicate document formats found\n- PRD exists as both whole.md AND prd/ folder\n- YOU MUST choose which version to use\n- Remove or rename the other version to avoid confusion\n```\n\n#### Missing Documents (WARNING)\n\nIf required documents not found:\n\n```\n⚠️ WARNING: Required document not found\n- Architecture document not found\n- Will impact assessment completeness\n```\n\n### 5. Add Initial Report Section\n\nInitialize {outputFile} with {templateFile}.\n\n### 6. Present Findings and Get Confirmation\n\nDisplay findings and ask:\n\"**Document Discovery Complete**\n\n[Show organized file list]\n\n**Issues Found:**\n\n- [List any duplicates requiring resolution]\n- [List any missing documents]\n\n**Required Actions:**\n\n- If duplicates exist: Please remove/rename one version\n- Confirm which documents to use for assessment\n\n**Ready to proceed?** [C] Continue after resolving issues\"\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: **Select an Option:** [C] Continue to File Validation\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed with 'C' selection\n- If duplicates identified, insist on resolution first\n- User can clarify file locations or request additional searches\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Save document inventory to {outputFile}, update frontmatter with completed step and files being included, and only then load read fully and execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then redisplay menu\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN C is selected and document inventory is saved will you load {nextStepFile} to begin file validation.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All document types searched systematically\n- Files organized and inventoried clearly\n- Duplicates identified and flagged for resolution\n- User confirmed file selections\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not searching all document types\n- Ignoring duplicate document conflicts\n- Proceeding without resolving critical issues\n- Not saving document inventory\n\n**Master Rule:** Clear file identification is essential for accurate assessment.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent.\nFR14: Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold.\nFR15: The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement.\nFR16: Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence.\nFR17: Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package.\nFR18: Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts.\nFR19: The system provides a conceptual model describing tenancy,

alone.\nFR28: 100% of refusal errors include actionable guidance and a link to the relevant contract rule, verified by contract tests.\nTotal FRs: 28\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements Extracted\n\nNFR1: The system shall reject 100% of operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution as measured by contract tests covering request, background, and admin paths.\nNFR2: Privileged or cross-scope actions shall require explicit scope declaration and justification fields, verified by contract tests for all privileged operations.\nNFR3: The system shall produce zero silent fallbacks when required context is missing, verified by negative tests in CI.\nNFR4: Security-relevant behavior shall be covered by contract tests with >=90% branch coverage in the enforcement module, measured in CI.\nNFR5: Invariant enforcement shall be deterministic across 10 repeated CI runs with identical inputs yielding identical outcomes (0 variance).\nNFR6: Failure modes shall return explicit error codes/messages for 100% of invariant violations, verified by contract tests.\nNFR7: Invariant check failures shall return within <=100ms at p95 in reference benchmarks.\nNFR8: Core guarantees shall pass the same contract tests across local and CI environments with 0 environment-specific skips.\nNFR9: All request paths shall pass through the single integration point in the reference project, verified by tracing tests with 100% coverage.\nNFR10: Integration shall require no changes to domain/business logic in the reference project (0 files under domain namespaces modified), verified by sample diff.\nNFR11: The integration guide shall include a full wiring example and complete successfully in <=30 minutes for a new service, measured in onboarding trials.\nNFR12: If the integration point is removed or bypassed, contract tests shall fail in CI with a specific error within a single test run.\nNFR13: Baseline overhead shall add <=1ms at p95 per request in a reference benchmark of 10,000 requests.\nNFR14: Enforcement checks shall add <=5% latency when tenant count scales from 1 to 10,000, measured by benchmark.\nNFR15: The baseline shall start zero background polling loops or timers by default, verified by runtime inspection tests.\nNFR16: Contract tests shall pass with tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000 in load simulations.\nNFR17: Reference architecture shall demonstrate multi-service and multi-database topology without special casing, verified by documented example and integration test.\nNFR18: All invariants shall remain enforced under 10x load compared to baseline, verified by load tests.\nNFR19: Accessibility is not applicable; TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.\nTotal NFRs: 19\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- UX documentation is not required for this project.\n- MVP support: .NET; Secondary distribution: npm package (for complementary tooling or examples); Out of scope for MVP: other runtimes/languages.\n- NuGet is the primary installation path; npm is for supporting tooling or integration snippets; no IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n- API surface must be small, stable, focused on tenant context, invariants, and verification hooks; avoid extension points that bypass invariants or widen core behavior; explicit refusal paths for ambiguous attribution or privileged actions.\n- Documentation required for MVP: concise conceptual model; explicit trust contract; define tenant_ref; minimal integration guide; runnable verification/contract tests guide; small API reference.\n- Code examples: one minimal sample project; copy-paste integration snippets; no full reference application for MVP.\n- MVP: no migration guide required (greenfield-first baseline); future: add migration guide if adopting into existing systems becomes a primary use case.\n- Resource requirements: 1 person with strong backend/systems thinking, multi-tenant architecture expertise, API/contract design, test rigor, and clear technical writing.\n- Must-have capabilities for Phase 1: explicit baseline model, one unavoidable integration point, enforced invariants (small, non-negotiable), verification mechanism, clear non-goals and refusal behavior, minimal sample + integration snippets, conceptual + contract documentation.\n\n### PRD Completeness Assessment\n\nThe PRD contains explicit FRs (28) and NFRs (19) with measurable criteria, plus clear scoping constraints for MVP vs. post-MVP. No UX document is required per scope, but UX artifacts are absent for any optional future phases.\n\n## Epic Coverage Validation\n\n### Coverage Matrix\n\n| FR Number | PRD Requirement | Epic Coverage | Status |\n| --------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------ |\n| FR1 | Platform engineers can define the canonical tenant identity model used across the system. | Epic 6, Story 6.1 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR2 | The system can represent tenant scope and shared-system scope as explicit, distinct contexts. | Epic 2, Story 2.1 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR3 | The system can represent a no tenant state only when explicitly justified by the trust contract. | Epic 2, Story 2.1 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR4 | Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution. | Epic 4, Story 4.1; Epic 4, Story 4.2 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR5 | The baseline model can be referenced as a single source of truth by services integrating it. | Epic 6, Story 6.4 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR6 | The system can refuse operations with ambiguous or missing tenant attribution. | Epic 3, Story 3.2; Epic 2, Story 2.2 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR7 | The system can enforce an explicit invariant set of <=7 invariants defined and enumerated in the trust contract. | Epic 2, Story 2.3 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR8 | Invariant enforcement applies uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths. | Epic 4, Story 4.4; Epic 4, Story 4.5 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR9 | The system can surface refusal reasons explicitly to developers when invariants are violated. | Epic 3, Story 3.3; Epic 3, Story 3.4 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR10 | Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent and cannot proceed silently. | Epic 3, Story 3.5; Epic 2, Story 2.4; Epic 5, Story 5.4 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR11 | The system provides a single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context initialization. | Epic 4, Story 4.1 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR12 | The integration point can propagate tenant context to downstream operations consistently. | Epic 4, Story 4.3; Epic 4, Story 4.2 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR13 | The integration point can reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent. | Epic 3, Story 3.1 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR14 | Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold. | Epic 6, Story 6.2; Epic 1, Story 1.1; Epic 6, Story 6.3 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR15 | The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement. | Epic 5, Story 5.1; Epic 5, Story 5.3; Epic 5, Story 5.4; Epic 5, Story 5.5 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR16 | Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence. | Epic 5, Story 5.1; Epic 5, Story 5.3 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR17 | Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package. | Epic 5, Story 5.1 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR18 | Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts. | Epic 5, Story 5.2 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR19 | The system provides a conceptual model describing tenancy, scope, and shared-system context in <=800 words or <=2 pages. | Epic 6, Story 6.4 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR20 | The system provides an explicit trust contract that defines invariants and refusal behavior. | Epic 2, Story 2.3; Epic 2, Story 2.4; Epic 2, Story 2.5; Epic 5, Story 5.5 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR21 | The system provides an integration guide with <=6 required steps and a reference setup time <=30 minutes. | Epic 6, Story 6.2; Epic 1, Story 1.1; Epic 1, Story 1.2; Epic 1, Story 1.3 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR22 | The system provides a verification guide that explains how to run and interpret contract tests. | Epic 6, Story 6.6 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR23 | The system provides an API reference that covers 100% of public surface area and lists all public types/entry points. | Epic 6, Story 6.7 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR24 | The system defines explicit boundaries where extensions may be built without weakening invariants. | Epic 6, Story 6.1; Epic 6, Story 6.3 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR25 | Adapters can integrate through sanctioned boundaries while preserving the trust contract. | Epic 6, Story 6.1 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR26 | The core surface blocks bypass paths by restricting entry points to sanctioned boundaries, verified by contract tests covering 100% of public entry points. | Epic 3, Story 3.1; Epic 5, Story 5.2 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR27 | New engineers can locate the trust contract and run contract tests within 60 minutes using the docs alone. | Epic 5, Story 5.1; Epic 6, Story 6.5; Epic 6, Story 6.6 | ✓ Covered |\n| FR28 | 100% of refusal errors include actionable guidance and a link to the relevant contract rule, verified by contract tests. | Epic 3, Story 3.3; Epic 3, Story 3.4; Epic 2, Story 2.3; Epic 2, Story 2.5; Epic 5, Story 5.5 | ✓ Covered |\n\n### Missing Requirements\n\nNone. All PRD FRs (FR1–FR28) are mapped to >=1 Epic/Story ID.\n\n### Invalid Mappings\n\nNone. All referenced Epic/Story IDs exist in the epics document.\n\n### Epic Independence Findings (Rubric C)\n\n- CRITICAL: Epic 3 depends on Epic 4 (higher-numbered epic), violating the epic independence rule.\n\n### Coverage Statistics\n\n- Total PRD FRs: 28\n- FRs covered in epics: 28\n- Coverage percentage: 100%\n\n## UX Alignment Assessment\n\n### UX Document Status\n\nNot Found. PRD contains the literal statement: \"UX documentation is not required for this project.\"\n\n### Alignment Issues\n\nNone. UX is explicitly out of scope per PRD.\n\n### Warnings\n\nNone.\n\n## Epic Quality Review (Rubric C/D/E/G)\n\n### Rubric C — Epic Independence (Critical)\n\n- CRITICAL: Epic 3 depends on Epic 4 (higher-numbered epic). This violates the epic independence rule.\n\n### Rubric D — Story Testability (Major)\n\n- D1 (>=2 Given/When/Then ACs): PASS — all stories have at least two Given/When/Then acceptance criteria.\n- D2 (Measurable artifact keyword in each AC): FAIL — at least one AC block in each story lacks a measurable artifact keyword (`test`, `log`, `response`, `error`, `event`, `metric`).\n  - Stories affected: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4.\n- D3 (Enforcement/guard stories require a negative AC with `refuse`, `error`, `fail`, or `block`): FAIL — the following enforcement/guard stories lack a negative AC keyword:\n  - Stories affected: 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 4.1, 4.4, 4.5, 5.2, 5.5, 7.1, 7.2.\n\n### Rubric E — Dependency Hygiene (Major)\n\n- PASS: All epics explicitly declare dependencies and no circular dependencies are present.\n\n### Rubric G — Documentation Requirements (Major)\n\n- FAIL: Documentation stories exist but none include an acceptance criterion with an explicit location path.\n  - Stories affected: 6.2 (Integration Guide), 6.5 (Trust Contract), 6.6 (Verification Guide), 6.7 (API Reference).\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- Resolve the Epic 3 → Epic 4 forward dependency by reordering epics or moving the dependent scope to an earlier epic.\n- Add measurable artifact keywords to every Given/When/Then AC block (e.g., reference a test, log, response, error, event, or metric).\n- For enforcement/guard stories, add at least one negative AC using `refuse`, `error`, `fail`, or `block`.\n- Add explicit documentation paths in doc-related stories (e.g., `docs/trust-contract.md`, `docs/integration-guide.md`).\n\n## Summary and Recommendations\n\n### Overall Readiness Status\n\nNEEDS WORK\n\n### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action\n\n- Epic 3 depends on Epic 4 (higher-numbered epic), violating rubric C (Epic Independence).\n\n### Major Issues Summary\n\n- Story testability: All stories (1.1–7.4) have at least one acceptance-criteria block missing a measurable artifact keyword (`test`, `log`, `response`, `error`, `event`, `metric`).\n- Enforcement/guard stories missing negative AC keywords (`refuse`, `error`, `fail`, `block`): 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 4.1, 4.4, 4.5, 5.2, 5.5, 7.1, 7.2.\n- Documentation stories missing explicit location paths in ACs: 6.2, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. Resolve the Epic 3 → Epic 4 forward dependency by reordering epics or moving the dependent scope earlier.\n2. Update every acceptance-criteria block to include at least one measurable artifact keyword (test/log/response/error/event/metric).\n3. Add at least one negative AC to each enforcement/guard story using `refuse`, `error`, `fail`, or `block`.\n4. Add explicit documentation paths to doc stories (e.g., `docs/trust-contract.md`, `docs/integration-guide.md`, `docs/verification-guide.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`).\n\n### Rubric-Based Tally\n\n- Critical: 1\n- Major: 48\n- Minor: 0\n\n### Final Note\n\nThis assessment identified 49 issues across 3 rubric categories. Address the critical issues before proceeding to implementation. These findings can be used to improve the artifacts or you may choose to proceed as-is.\n\n**Assessor:** John (Product Manager)\n**Assessment Date:** 2026-01-29\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Extract Functional Requirements (FRs)\n\nSearch for and extract:\n\n- Numbered FRs (FR1, FR2, FR3, etc.)\n- Requirements labeled \"Functional Requirement\"\n- User stories or use cases that represent functional needs\n- Business rules that must be implemented\n\nFormat findings as:\n\n```\n## Functional Requirements Extracted\n\nFR1: [Complete requirement text]\nFR2: [Complete requirement text]\nFR3: [Complete requirement text]\n...\nTotal FRs: [count]\n```\n\n### 4. Extract Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n\nSearch for and extract:\n\n- Performance requirements (response times, throughput)\n- Security requirements (authentication, encryption, etc.)\n- Usability requirements (accessibility, ease of use)\n- Reliability requirements (uptime, error rates)\n- Scalability requirements (concurrent users, data growth)\n- Compliance requirements (standards, regulations)\n\nFormat findings as:\n\n```\n## Non-Functional Requirements Extracted\n\nNFR1: [Performance requirement]\nNFR2: [Security requirement]\nNFR3: [Usability requirement]\n...\nTotal NFRs: [count]\n```\n\n### 5. Document Additional Requirements\n\nLook for:\n\n- Constraints or assumptions\n- Technical requirements not labeled as FR/NFR\n- Business constraints\n- Integration requirements\n\n### 6. Add to Assessment Report\n\nAppend to {outputFile}:\n\n```markdown\n## PRD Analysis\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n[Complete FR list from section 3]\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n[Complete NFR list from section 4]\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n[Any other requirements or constraints found]\n\n### PRD Completeness Assessment\n\n[Initial assessment of PRD completeness and clarity]\n```\n\n### 7. Auto-Proceed to Next Step\n\nAfter PRD analysis complete, immediately load next step for epic coverage validation.\n\n## PROCEEDING TO EPIC COVERAGE VALIDATION\n\nPRD analysis complete. Loading next step to validate epic coverage.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- PRD loaded and read completely\n- All FRs extracted with full text\n- All NFRs identified and documented\n- Findings added to assessment report\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not reading complete PRD (especially sharded versions)\n- Missing requirements in extraction\n- Summarizing instead of extracting full text\n- Not documenting findings in report\n\n**Master Rule:** Complete requirement extraction is essential for traceability validation.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It targets platform engineers, founders, and security reviewers who need explicit, verifiable guarantees rather than framework-driven scaffolding. Differentiation comes from invariant-first design, explicit refusal behavior, and runnable contract tests that prove guarantees hold across execution paths.\n\n**Problem Statement:** Multi-tenant systems routinely allow actions with ambiguous tenant scope or authority, creating latent cross-tenant risks that are only discovered after incidents.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\nThe primary \"aha\" is a posture shift: teams stop debating multi-tenant assumptions because the baseline makes them obvious.\n\nPrimary signals:\n- New services/features fit cleanly into the baseline without redesign.\n- Developers hit constraints early and think \"good - this would have been messy later.\"\n- The trust contract is treated as the default, not a suggestion.\n\nSecondary signals:\n- Dangerous operations are surfaced explicitly instead of silently allowed.\n- New engineers can learn tenancy from code, not Slack history.\n\n**Metrics (6 months):**\n- >=3 new services integrate TenantSaas within 2 sprints of project start.\n- >=80% of new multi-tenant features ship without baseline redesign.\n- >=90% of services keep the baseline enabled after initial adoption.\n- New engineer onboarding to tenancy concepts takes <=1 day using docs + contract tests.\n\n### Business Success\n\n**~3 months (validation):**\n- Integrated into >=3 real (non-demo) projects.\n- >=50% of integrations happen at project start (greenfield).\n- >=70% of adopters keep it after initial experimentation.\n- >=3 feedback items explicitly reference it as a \"baseline\" or \"foundation.\"\n- >=2 internal docs or architecture notes cite it.\nValidation: the right users take it seriously and keep it.\n\n**~12 months (traction):**\n- Repeat usage by >=2 teams across >=2 projects each.\n- Annual retention >=80% among adopters.\n- >=3 external or internal mentions in blogs, architecture forums, or platform standards.\n- >=5 pull-through requests for examples/extensions/integrations (not core expansion).\n- >=2 teams describe it as infrastructure they would not remove without concern.\nValidation: it is treated as infrastructure, not a trial tool.\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Core invariants are enforced through unavoidable integration points.\n- Ambiguous or unattributed operations are refused by default.\n- Contract/verification tests exist, are runnable by adopters, and are executed in CI.\n- The core API surface stays small, stable, and resists ad-hoc extension.\n- Behavior is consistent across request paths, background execution, and admin/scripted usage.\nTechnical success = guarantees hold even as usage patterns expand.\n\n**Metrics (technical):**\n- 100% of defined invariants are enforced by contract tests across request, background, and admin paths.\n- Contract test suite runs in CI in <=10 minutes on reference projects.\n- Zero P0/P1 incidents caused by tenant-scope violations in adopter projects during first 6 months.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Multiple real projects integrate TenantSaas, with at least some greenfield starts.\n- Retention after initial experimentation (kept in place).\n- Documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- Contract tests running in CI across adopters.\n- Repeat adoption across projects by the same teams.\n\n**Metrics (measurable outcomes):**\n- >=3 real integrations, with >=1 greenfield.\n- >=70% retention after initial experimentation.\n- >=2 documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- >=2 adopters running contract tests in CI.\n- >=2 repeat adoptions by the same team/org.\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Explicit baseline model for multi-tenant SaaS.\n- One or more enforced invariants that remove ambiguity early.\n- A single unavoidable integration point anchoring the baseline.\n- Verification mechanism (tests/assertions) that proves rules hold.\n- Documentation that explains the model and contract (not features).\n- UX documentation is not required for this project.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Optional extensions/adapters.\n- Reference implementations or example apps.\n- Additional verification/reporting hooks.\n- Integration patterns for common tooling.\n- Better ergonomics around configuration and visibility.\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Recognized baseline for serious multi-tenant systems.\n- Core remains small and conservative.\n- Innovation primarily in extensions/examples/ecosystem contributions.\n- Shapes how teams think about SaaS foundations, not just scaffolding.\n- Referenced as a trust kernel, not marketed as a framework.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### 1) Platform engineer integrating TenantSaas into a new service\n\n**Opening scene:** Maya owns platform standards and is starting a new service in a growing SaaS stack. She is wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.\n**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.\n**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution. It forces a decision at design time, not after launch.\n**Resolution:** Maya adopts the trust contract as a shared team standard. The new service fits into existing architecture without special cases, and future services reuse the same baseline without re-debate.\n\n### 2) On-call responder using elevated scope during an incident (edge case)\n\n**Opening scene:** Jordan is on call when a cross-tenant data correction is required under time pressure.\n**Rising action:** Jordan attempts a privileged operation; the system requires explicit scope elevation with clear intent, not silent admin access.\n**Climax:** The system allows the operation only through a constrained path that is visible and auditable, avoiding accidental overreach.\n**Resolution:** The fix is applied quickly without bypassing the baseline. The incident is resolved and the audit trail is clean, with no special exceptions introduced.\n\n### 3) Founder / early builder adopting at project start\n\n**Opening scene:** Priya is starting a new SaaS product and wants to avoid fixing multi-tenancy later.\n**Rising action:** She adds TenantSaas early because it is small, explicit, and does not prescribe a full framework.\n**Climax:** The baseline forces clarity around tenant context at the first integration point, and Priya realizes she does not need to invent her own conventions.\n**Resolution:** The team moves fast with confidence, knowing the core assumptions are locked in without slowing momentum.\n\n### 4) Security/compliance stakeholder reviewing guarantees\n\n**Opening scene:** Alex is asked to assess tenant isolation guarantees before an external review.\n**Rising action:** Alex inspects the trust contract and verification artifacts rather than chasing tribal knowledge.\n**Climax:** The evidence shows invariants enforced at unavoidable choke points, with contract tests that can be executed in CI.\n**Resolution:** Alex can approve the baseline as a credible control, because the guarantees are explicit and verifiable, not implied.\n\n### 5) API/integration contributor extending or adapting the core\n\n**Opening scene:** Sam wants to create an adapter for a different stack while keeping the core intact.\n**Rising action:** Sam reviews the constraints and sees where extensions are allowed versus where invariants are non-negotiable.\n**Climax:** The adapter integrates through the sanctioned boundary and inherits the same guarantees without widening the core API.\n**Resolution:** The extension adds reach without fragmenting the baseline, and the core remains intentionally small.\n\n### 6) New engineer onboarding into an existing system (acceptance signal)\n\n**Opening scene:** Riley joins an existing team mid-project.\n**Rising action:** Riley reads the baseline code and its contract tests rather than relying on oral history.\n**Climax:** A constrained operation makes the rules explicit, and the correct pattern is discoverable in code.\n**Resolution:** Onboarding requires fewer explanations, which acts as an acceptance signal that the baseline is doing its job.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- A single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context.\n- Explicit tenant attribution required before operations proceed.\n- Controlled, auditable elevation paths for privileged actions.\n- A clear, inspectable trust contract with runnable verification tests.\n- An extension model that preserves invariants and keeps the core small.\n- Baseline conventions are discoverable in code, not tribal knowledge.\n\n## Developer Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTenantSaas is a developer-facing foundation package for .NET-first multi-tenant systems, with a secondary npm distribution. It is embedded into existing systems as a baseline, not a standalone product.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- The core package must be minimal, invariant-driven, and safe by default.\n- A single, unavoidable integration point anchors tenant context for request paths and background execution.\n- Verification artifacts (contract tests) are part of the core deliverable and runnable by adopters.\n\n### Language Support (Language Matrix)\n\n- **MVP support:** .NET\n- **Secondary distribution:** npm package (for complementary tooling or examples)\n- **Out of scope for MVP:** other runtimes/languages\n\n### Installation Methods\n\n- **NuGet** as the primary installation path.\n- **npm** for any supporting tooling or integration snippets.\n- No IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n\n### API Surface\n\n- Small, stable API surface focused on tenant context, invariants, and verification hooks.\n- Avoid extension points that bypass invariants or widen core behavior.\n- Explicit refusal paths for ambiguous attribution or privileged actions.\n\n### Documentation & Guides (Required for MVP)\n\n- Concise conceptual model.\n- Explicit trust contract.\n- Define `tenant_ref`: a disclosure-safe tenant identifier used in logs/errors; either an opaque public tenant ID or a safe-state token (`unknown`, `sensitive`, `cross_tenant`) when disclosure is unsafe.\n- Minimal integration guide.\n- Runnable verification/contract tests guide.\n- Small API reference (focused on the core surface only).\n\n### Code Examples\n\n- One minimal sample project.\n- Copy-paste integration snippets.\n- No full reference application for MVP.\n\n### Migration Guide\n\n- MVP: no migration guide required (greenfield-first baseline).\n- Future: add a migration guide if adopting into existing systems becomes a primary use case.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Baseline must be hard to remove once integrated, without adding operational friction.\n- Contract tests should be easily wired into CI with minimal configuration.\n- Keep documentation crisp and enforce the mental model over feature descriptions.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Problem-solving MVP (prove guarantees are real and usable), with platform discipline for extensibility.\n**Resource Requirements:** 1 person with strong backend/systems thinking, multi-tenant architecture expertise, API/contract design, test rigor, and clear technical writing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Platform engineer integrating into a new service\n- Founder/early builder starting a project\n- Security/compliance reviewer inspecting guarantees\n- Contributor reading/extending the core (design-level)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Explicit baseline model (tenancy, shared system, scope)\n- One unavoidable integration point\n- Enforced invariants (small, non-negotiable)\n- Verification mechanism (contract tests or equivalent)\n- Clear non-goals and refusal behavior\n- Minimal sample + integration snippets\n- Conceptual + contract documentation\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- On-call incident workflows (documented, not deeply supported)\n- New-hire onboarding narratives\n- Advanced ops/support tooling\n- Additional adapters or helpers\n- Observability hooks\n- More ergonomic APIs\n- Extended examples (jobs, reporting, admin)\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Reference app\n- Ecosystem packages and optional extensions\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Guarantees too weak to matter or too rigid to use. Mitigate by keeping invariants minimal, validating in at least one real integration, and treating escape hatches as design failures unless explicitly justified.\n**Market Risks:** Misinterpreted as just another library or too abstract. Mitigate by leading with problem framing, stating non-goals clearly, and anchoring messaging on baseline/foundation rather than productivity.\n**Resource Risks:** Over-engineering and drifting into framework territory. Mitigate by freezing scope, requiring a new invariant for any new capability, and deleting ideas rather than deferring them.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Tenant Context & Baseline Model\n\n-

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(Derived from PRD FR2)  \nFR2b: No-tenant context is an explicit state (not a null tenant) and carries a reason/category defined by the trust contract (e.g., Public, Bootstrap, HealthCheck, SystemMaintenance). (Derived from PRD FR3)  \nFR3: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.  \nFR4: Tenant context is available via an explicit API and optionally via an ambient context with deterministic propagation across async boundaries.  \nFR5: Each execution flow has one required context initialization point (request, background job, admin/scripted), meaning the first moment a context object is established.  \nFR5a: Enforcement operates correctly with either explicit context passing or ambient propagation without weakening invariants. (Derived from PRD FR4/FR12)  \nFR6: Enforcement occurs at a small set of boundary helpers/middleware/interceptors, not a full framework.  \nFR6a: Invariant evaluation and tenant context initialization are idempotent and side-effect-free by default (no network calls, persistence writes, or background scheduling). (Derived from Architecture constraints)  \nFR7: Operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution are refused by default.  \nFR7a: Tenant attribution uses a declared set of allowed sources (e.g., route, header, host, token claims) with an explicit precedence order. (Derived from PRD FR6)  \nFR7b: If multiple allowed sources disagree, attribution is ambiguous and must refuse. (Derived from PRD FR6)  \nFR7c: If a source is not allowed for the given endpoint or execution kind, attribution must refuse. (Derived from PRD FR6)  \nFR8: Invariants are enumerated, named, finite, and defined in the trust contract.  \nFR9: Enforcement applies across defined execution paths; execution kind is captured in context.  \nFR10: Refusal reasons are explicit and developer-facing.  \nFR11: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent; break-glass requires actor identity + reason and is auditable; it is never implicit or default.  \nFR11a: Break-glass emits a standard audit event containing actor, reason, scope, target_tenant_ref (or cross-tenant marker), trace_id, and invariant_code (or audit_code). (Derived from PRD FR10)  \nFR12: Verification artifacts are provided as a test helper package plus a reference test suite, runnable by adopters in CI without specialized tooling.  \nFR13: The trust contract defines invariants, allowed contexts, break-glass semantics, disclosure policy, and standardized refusal mappings (status + invariant_code + guidance link).  \nFR14: Documentation includes a concise conceptual model, an explicit trust contract, an integration guide, a verification guide, and an API reference.  \nFR15: The package provides shared types and conventions intended to serve as the canonical reference for tenancy.  \nFR16: Extension boundaries are explicit and named (e.g., ITenantResolver, ITenantContextAccessor, IInvariantEvaluator, IInvariantViolationMapper, ILogEnricher).  \nFR17: Sanctioned extensions can integrate without weakening invariants.  \nFR18: All refusals include invariant_code + trace_id; request_id is included for request execution. (Derived from Architecture constraints)  \nFR19: Tenant disclosure policy is explicit: tenant_ref is always logged using safe states; errors include tenant info only when safe to disclose. (Derived from PRD documentation requirements)  \n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNote: Letter-suffixed items (e.g., NFR5a) are derived clarifications from the PRD/Architecture and do not add new scope beyond PRD intent.\n\nNFR1: The system rejects operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution.  \nNFR2: Privileged or cross-scope actions require explicit scope declaration and justification.  \nNFR3: No silent fallbacks when required context is missing.  \nNFR4: Enforcement is deterministic for identical inputs within the same environment.  \nNFR5: Invariant violations return explicit error codes/messages with stable invariant_code values.  \nNFR5a: invariant_code values and Problem Details type identifiers are stable within a major version; breaking changes require a major version bump and documented migration notes. (Derived from PRD NFR5)  \nNFR5b: Contract-test helper APIs follow the same major-version stability guarantees. (Derived from PRD NFR5)  \nNFR6: Contract tests demonstrate behavior across execution kinds supported by the reference sample; helpers allow adopters to map their own execution kinds to the same assertions.  \nNFR7: Integration is non-invasive to domain/business logic; changes are confined to boundary/configuration code.  \nNFR8: Bypassing initialization results in refusal with explicit diagnostics.  \nNFR9: Baseline overhead is low and benchmarked; published targets include machine specs and methodology.  \nNFR10: Enforcement scales with tenant count; benchmarks are published for reference loads.  \nNFR11: No default background polling loops or timers are started by the baseline.  \nNFR12: Reference load simulations include tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000 (for published benchmarks).  \nNFR13: Accessibility is not applicable (no end-user UI).  \n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- Baseline constraints:\n  - Core is storage-agnostic; EF Core adapter is reference-only.  \n  - Errors use RFC 7807 Problem Details with invariant_code + trace_id.  \n- Structured logging requires tenant_ref, trace_id, request_id, invariant_code, event_name, severity; tenant_ref follows disclosure policy.  \n- Definition: `tenant_ref` is the disclosure-safe tenant identifier used in logs/errors. It is either an opaque public tenant ID or a safe-state token (`unknown`, `sensitive`, `cross_tenant`) when disclosure is unsafe; it must not be a raw internal ID or reversible identifier.  \n  - Refuse-by-default enforcement with explicit break-glass path.  \n  - BYO-auth posture (sample auth is illustrative only).  \n  - Rate limiting is documented, not implemented in core.  \n- Verification strategy (separate from requirements, but required deliverables):\n  - Black-box contract tests cover refusal on missing/ambiguous context and cross-tenant access.  \n  - Break-glass path requires explicit declaration and is auditable.  \n  - Error shape/log enrichment/correlation rules are asserted.  \n  - Adopters can run the contract test helper package in their own CI.  \n- Reference implementation choices (non-binding):\n  - .NET-first sample; packaging and exact target frameworks are implementation decisions.  \n  - Minimal APIs + Swagger in the sample host.  \n  - SQLite for the sample datastore.  \n  - Repo layout and scaffolding commands are implementation plans, not product requirements.  \n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nNote: FR2a/2b/5a/6a/7a/7b/7c/11a/18/19 are derived

Bootstrap a Runnable Baseline (Greenfield Setup)\n\nEnable a team to start from a supported template, run locally, and verify CI early so the first service can adopt the baseline without guesswork.\n\n### Story 1.1: Initialize Project from the Approved .NET Template\n\n**Implements:** FR14, FR21\n**Related NFRs:** NFR7\n\nAs a platform engineer,  \nI want a documented, repeatable project initialization step,  \nSo that the baseline starts from a supported .NET SDK template with known structure.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the approved .NET SDK templates  \n**When** I initialize the repo  \n**Then** the solution, core library, and reference host are created from the documented template  \n**And** the initialization steps are written in the setup guide\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the project is initialized  \n**When** a required template or dependency is missing  \n**Then** the setup guide provides a clear failure message and resolution steps\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 1.2: Local Development Environment Setup\n\n**Implements:** FR21\n**Related NFRs:** NFR7\n\nAs a developer,  \nI want a minimal local setup process,  \nSo that I can build and run the reference host without tribal knowledge.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** a new machine with the documented prerequisites  \n**When** I follow the setup steps  \n**Then** I can build and run the reference host locally  \n**And** the reference host starts and responds to a basic health check\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a missing prerequisite  \n**When** I run the setup steps  \n**Then** the failure is explicit and points to the missing dependency\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 1.3: CI Pipeline Skeleton (Build + Smoke Checks)\n\n**Implements:** FR21\n**Related NFRs:** NFR7\n\nAs a team lead,  \nI want a CI workflow skeleton that builds and runs basic smoke checks,  \nSo that the baseline can be validated on every pull request without waiting on later epics.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the CI workflow definition  \n**When** I open a pull request  \n**Then** the build and smoke checks run automatically and fail the build on errors\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a known failing test or build error is introduced  \n**When** the CI pipeline runs  \n**Then** the pipeline fails with a specific, documented error\n\n## Epic 2: Teams Can Understand and Trust the Contract\n\nProvide an explicit, readable trust contract (scopes, invariants, attribution rules, disclosure policy, refusal mapping, and break-glass semantics) that adopters can treat as the system’s source of truth.\n\n### Story 2.1: Define Context Taxonomy and Execution Kinds\n\n**Implements:** FR2, FR3\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a concrete context taxonomy and execution kind model,\nSo that every enforcement decision has unambiguous inputs.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the Trust Contract v1 scope  \n**When** I review the core contracts  \n**Then** I can find explicit definitions for tenant scope, shared-system scope, and no-tenant context  \n**And** no-tenant context requires a reason/category from an allowed set\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the context model  \n**When** execution occurs in request, background, admin, or scripted flows  \n**Then** the execution kind is represented explicitly in the context  \n**And** it is available to enforcement, logging, and refusal mapping\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the trust contract is missing a required scope or execution kind definition  \n**When** the contract is reviewed  \n**Then** the gap is explicitly documented as a blocking issue before implementation proceeds\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 2.2: Define Tenant Attribution Sources, Precedence, and Ambiguity Rules\n\n**Implements:** FR6, FR20\n**Related NFRs:** NFR1, NFR3\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want a declared tenant attribution contract,\nSo that tenant resolution is deterministic and disagreements are refused.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** tenant attribution is required  \n**When** I inspect the tenant resolution contract  \n**Then** I see an allowed set of attribution sources  \n**And** I see a clear precedence order across those sources\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** two allowed sources disagree on tenant identity  \n**When** tenant attribution is evaluated  \n**Then** the attribution is classified as ambiguous  \n**And** enforcement can refuse with a stable invariant_code\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 2.3: Define Invariant Registry and Refusal Mapping Schema\n\n**Implements:** FR7, FR20, FR28\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs a product owner,\nI want invariants and refusals defined as data,\nSo that behavior is stable, testable, and versionable.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** Trust Contract v1 invariants  \n**When** I review the invariant registry shape  \n**Then** each invariant has a stable identifier and name  \n**And** invariants can be referenced by enforcement, tests, and documentation\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** an invariant violation  \n**When** refusal mapping is applied  \n**Then** there is a defined mapping to status, invariant_code, and guidance link  \n**And** the schema supports stable Problem Details type identifiers\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 2.4: Define Break-Glass Contract and Standard Audit Event Schema\n\n**Implements:** FR10, FR20\n**Related NFRs:** NFR2\n\nAs a security reviewer,\nI want break-glass to be explicit and auditable by contract,\nSo that escalations are safer than normal flows, not looser.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** a privileged or cross-tenant operation  \n**When** break-glass is used  \n**Then** the contract requires actor identity, reason, and declared scope  \n**And** the contract forbids implicit or default break-glass activation\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** break-glass is exercised  \n**When** the audit event is emitted  \n**Then** it includes actor, reason, scope, target_tenant_ref (or cross-tenant marker), trace_id, and invariant_code (or audit_code)  \n**And** the event schema is stable and documented\n\n### Story 2.5: Define Disclosure Policy and tenant_ref Safe States\n\n**Implements:** FR20, FR28\n**Related NFRs:** NFR1, NFR3\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want a precise disclosure policy,\nSo that logs and errors do not become tenant existence oracles.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** tenant disclosure is evaluated  \n**When** I review the disclosure policy contract  \n**Then** I see defined tenant_ref safe states (e.g., unknown, sensitive, cross_tenant, opaque id)  \n**And** the policy specifies when tenant information may appear in errors\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a refusal occurs  \n**When** Problem Details are constructed  \n**Then** tenant information is included only when disclosure is safe  \n**And** the policy is available to refusal mapping and logging enrichment\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n## Epic 3: Unsafe Operations Are Blocked by Default\n\nEnsure unsafe or ambiguous operations are refused at clear enforcement boundaries with explicit errors and auditable break-glass.\n\n### Story 3.1: Enforce ContextInitialized at Boundary Helpers\n\n**Implements:** FR13, FR26\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want boundary enforcement to refuse when context is not initialized,\nSo that missing tenant context fails immediately and predictably.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** an operation enters a sanctioned enforc…784 tokens truncated…iers are exposed when disclosure is unsafe\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 3.5: Require Explicit Break-Glass with Audit Event Emission\n\n**Implements:** FR10\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs an on-call responder,\nI want break-glass to be explicit, constrained, and auditable,\nSo that escalations are safer than normal flows, not looser.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** a privileged or cross-tenant operation is attempted  \n**When** break-glass is not explicitly declared with actor, reason, and scope  \n**Then** the operation is refused  \n**And** the refusal references BreakGlassExplicitAndAudited\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** break-glass is explicitly declared and allowed  \n**When** the operation proceeds  \n**Then** a standard audit event is emitted per the trust contract  \n**And** the audit event includes actor, reason, scope, target_tenant_ref (or cross-tenant marker), trace_id, and invariant_code (or audit_code)\n\n\n**Given** break-glass is attempted without required actor and reason  \n**When** the operation is evaluated  \n**Then** the operation must refuse with an error and be blocked\n\n## Epic 4: Tenancy Is Initialized and Propagated Reliably\n\nProvide a clear initialization primitive and deterministic propagation so tenancy context is consistent across all execution flows.\n\n\n### Story 4.1: Provide a Single Required Initialization Primitive per Flow\n\n**Implements:** FR4, FR11\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want a clear initialization primitive,\nSo that I know exactly where tenancy is established for each execution flow.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** a request, background job, admin task, or scripted flow  \n**When** I integrate the baseline  \n**Then** there is one required initialization primitive for that flow  \n**And** it produces a context object with scope, execution kind, and attribution inputs\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** initialization is attempted multiple times in the same flow  \n**When** initialization runs  \n**Then** it behaves idempotently  \n**And** it does not create conflicting context state\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** an execution flow without initialization  \n**When** a boundary is invoked  \n**Then** enforcement refuses with the ContextInitialized invariant  \n**And** the refusal is testable via contract tests\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n\n**Given** a flow attempts boundary execution without initialization  \n**When** enforcement evaluates the request  \n**Then** the operation must refuse with an error\n\n### Story 4.2: Support Explicit Context Passing Without Ambient Requirements\n\n**Implements:** FR4, FR12\n**Related NFRs:** NFR4\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want enforcement to work with explicit context passing,\nSo that I can avoid hidden behavior and framework coupling.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** a valid context object  \n**When** it is passed explicitly to enforcement boundaries  \n**Then** invariants are evaluated correctly  \n**And** no ambient context is required for correctness\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** explicit context passing is used  \n**When** context is missing or inconsistent  \n**Then** enforcement refuses with standardized Problem Details  \n**And** the refusal includes invariant_code and trace_id\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 4.3: Provide Ambient Context Propagation with Deterministic Async Behavior\n\n**Implements:** FR12\n**Related NFRs:** NFR4\n\nAs a developer,\nI want ambient context propagation as an option,\nSo that I can reduce plumbing without weakening guarantees.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** ambient propagation is enabled  \n**When** execution crosses async boundaries within the same flow  \n**Then** the tenant context remains available deterministically  \n**And** enforcement outcomes match the explicit passing model\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** ambient context is enabled  \n**When** a new execution flow begins  \n**Then** no prior context leaks into the new flow  \n**And** context must be explicitly initialized for the new flow\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 4.4: Provide Flow Wrappers for Background, Admin, and Scripted Execution\n\n**Implements:** FR8\n**Related NFRs:** NFR8\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want clear wrappers for non-request execution kinds,\nSo that tenancy is established consistently outside HTTP.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** a background, admin, or scripted operation  \n**When** I use the provided flow wrapper  \n**Then** the wrapper requires explicit initialization inputs  \n**And** it sets execution kind and scope in the context\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a flow wrapper is bypassed  \n**When** enforcement is evaluated downstream  \n**Then** missing context is refused by default  \n**And** the refusal references the ContextInitialized invariant\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n\n**Given** a background/admin/scripted operation skips the flow wrapper  \n**When** enforcement evaluates the boundary  \n**Then** the operation must refuse with an error\n\n### Story 4.5: Capture Execution Kind and Scope in Context for Downstream Use\n\n**Implements:** FR8\n**Related NFRs:** NFR4\n\nAs a security reviewer,\nI want execution kind and scope captured in context,\nSo that enforcement, logging, and auditing use consistent semantics.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** any initialized context  \n**When** it is inspected by enforcement, logging, or audit mapping  \n**Then** execution kind and scope are available as first-class fields  \n**And** they align with the trust contract taxonomy\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a context is initialized without execution kind or scope  \n**When** enforcement is evaluated  \n**Then** the operation is refused with a standardized Problem Details response  \n**And** the refusal includes invariant_code and trace_id\n\n\n**Given** execution kind or scope is missing in context  \n**When** enforcement runs  \n**Then** the operation must fail with an error\n\n## Epic 5: Teams Can Prove Compliance in CI\n\nShip adopter-runnable contract tests and reference suites that prove invariants, refusals, disclosure policy, and auditing behavior.\n\n\n### Story 5.1: Ship an Adopter-Runnable Contract Test Helper Package\n\n**Implements:** FR15, FR16, FR17, FR27\n**Related NFRs:** NFR6\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want contract test helpers I can run in my own CI,\nSo that compliance is a binary signal rather than a review process.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the contract test helper package  \n**When** I add it to my test suite  \n**Then** I can run black-box assertions without specialized tooling  \n**And** the helpers align with the trust contract invariants and refusal mappings\n\n**Given** helper APIs are used  \n**When** versions change within a major version  \n**Then** helper contracts remain stable  \n**And** breaking changes require a major version bump with migration notes\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 5.2: Provide Reference Compliance Tests for Refusal and Attribution Rules\n\n**Implements:** FR18, FR26\n**Related NFRs:** NFR1, NFR3\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want reference tests that prove the guardrails work,\nSo that I can see failures when invariants are violated.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** reference compliance tests  \n**When** context is missing, ambiguous, or disallowed  \n**Then** operations are refused by default  \n**And** refusals reference the appropriate invariants\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** attribution sources disagree  \n**When** compliance tests run  \n**Then** attribution is treated as ambiguous  \n**And** refusal behavior is consistent with the trust contract\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n\n**Given** attribution sources disagree  \n**When** compliance tests execute  \n**Then** the test must fail and report an error refusal\n\n### Story 5.3: Integrate Contract Tests into CI\n\n**Implements:** FR16, FR15\n**Related NFRs:** NFR6\n\nAs a team lead,\nI want contract tests wired into CI,\nSo that baseline compliance is enforced before merges.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the CI workflow definition  \n**When** I open a pull request  \n**Then** contract tests run automatically and fail the build on invariant violations\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the enforcement boundary is bypassed  \n**When** the CI pipeline runs  \n**Then** the contract test job fails with a specific, documented error\n\n### Story 5.4: Assert Break-Glass Constraints and Audit Event Emission\n\n**Implements:** FR10, FR15\n**Related NFRs:** NFR2\n\nAs a security stakeholder,\nI want break-glass behavior proven by tests,\nSo that escalations cannot bypass the contract silently.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** break-glass is not explicitly declared  \n**When** privileged or cross-tenant operations are attempted  \n**Then** compliance tests fail with a refusal  \n**And** the refusal references BreakGlassExplicitAndAudited\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** break-glass is explicitly declared and allowed  \n**When** the operation proceeds in reference tests  \n**Then** a standard audit event is emitted  \n**And** the audit event includes the contract-required fields\n\n### Story 5.5: Assert Disclosure Policy and Error/Log Correlation Rules\n\n**Implements:** FR20, FR28, FR15\n**Related NFRs:** NFR1, NFR3\n\nAs an auditor,\nI want disclosure safety and correlation proven by contract tests,\nSo that logs and errors are safe and diagnosable together.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** a refusal occurs under sensitive disclosure conditions  \n**When** compliance tests inspect Problem Details and logs  \n**Then** tenant information is withheld or redacted per policy  \n**And** tenant_ref uses safe-state values\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** any invariant refusal occurs  \n**When** compliance tests inspect output  \n**Then** invariant_code and trace_id appear in both errors and logs  \n**And** request_id appears for request execution kinds\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n\n**Given** disclosure is unsafe  \n**When** compliance tests validate outputs  \n**Then** an error must refuse to expose tenant identifiers\n\n## Epic 6: Adoption Is Fast and Portable\n\nDeliver complete docs and extension seams so teams can integrate quickly without rewriting domain logic or weakening invariants.\n\n\n### Story 6.1: Define and Document Named Extension Seams\n\n**Implements:** FR1, FR24, FR25\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want explicit extension seams,\nSo that I can integrate with my stack without weakening invariants.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the extension model  \n**When** I review the contracts  \n**Then** I see named seams for tenant resolution, context access, invariant evaluation, refusal mapping, and log enrichment  \n**And** each seam states what is customizable versus invariant-protected\n\n**Given** extensions are implemented  \n**When** compliance tests are run  \n**Then** extensions can pass without bypassing enforcement boundaries\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 6.2: Provide a Boundary-Only Integration Guide\n\n**Implements:** FR14, FR21\n**Related NFRs:** NFR7\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want an integration guide that avoids domain rewrites,\nSo that adoption cost stays low.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the integration guide  \n**When** I follow it end to end  \n**Then** integration steps are focused on boundaries and configuration  \n**And** the guide makes no requirement to rewrite domain logic\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** integration is complete  \n**When** I run compliance tests  \n**Then** they exercise the configured boundaries successfully  \n**And** failures point back to specific contract rules\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a boundary is skipped or misconfigured  \n**When** I run the integration guide’s verification steps  \n**Then** the failure is explicit and references the missing boundary configuration\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the integration guide is finalized  \n**When** documentation is published  \n**Then** the guide is available at `docs/integration-guide.md` and referenced by a documentation test\n\n### Story 6.3: Prove Storage-Agnostic Core with Reference-Only Adapters\n\n**Implements:** FR14, FR24\n**Related NFRs:** NFR7\n\nAs a technical lead,\nI want confidence that the core stays storage-agnostic,\nSo that the baseline remains portable across data layers.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the core packages  \n**When** dependencies are reviewed  \n**Then** storage-specific dependencies are not required by the core  \n**And** reference adapters are isolated as optional components\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the reference adapter is used  \n**When** it integrates with the core  \n**Then** it uses sanctioned seams and boundaries  \n**And** the core invariants remain enforced\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 6.4: Publish the Conceptual Model\n\n**Implements:** FR5, FR19\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want a concise conceptual model,\nSo that I can understand tenancy, scope, and shared-system context quickly.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the documentation set  \n**When** I review it as a new adopter  \n**Then** I can find the conceptual model document  \n**And** it is <=800 words or <=2 pages and links to the trust contract\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the conceptual model exceeds the length constraint  \n**When** documentation is reviewed  \n**Then** the overage is flagged and corrected before release\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 6.5: Publish the Trust Contract\n\n**Implements:** FR27\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want an explicit trust contract document,\nSo that invariants, refusals, and disclosure rules are unambiguous.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the documentation set  \n**When** I review it as a new adopter  \n**Then** I can find the trust contract document  \n**And** it defines invariants, refusal behavior, and disclosure policy with stable identifiers\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the trust contract is missing a required invariant or refusal mapping  \n**When** documentation is reviewed  \n**Then** the issue is flagged as a release blocker  \n**And** the missing section is added before release\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the trust contract is finalized  \n**When** documentation is published  \n**Then** the contract is available at `docs/trust-contract.md` and referenced by a documentation test\n\n### Story 6.6: Publish the Verification Guide\n\n**Implements:** FR22, FR27\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want a verification guide,\nSo that I can run and interpret contract tests quickly.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the documentation set  \n**When** I review it as a new adopter  \n**Then** I can find the verification guide  \n**And** it explains how to run and interpret contract tests end to end\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a verification step fails or is out of date  \n**When** the guide is followed  \n**Then** the failure is reproducible  \n**And** the guide is updated with the corrected steps\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** the verification guide is finalized  \n**When** documentation is published  \n**Then** the guide is available at `docs/verification-guide.md` and referenced by a documentation test\n\n### Story 6.7: Publish the API Reference\n\n**Implements:** FR23\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want a complete API reference,\nSo that I can integrate with confidence and avoid hidden surface area.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the API reference  \n**When** public surface area changes  \n**Then** the reference updates in the same change  \n**And** contract identifiers remain stable within a major version\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a public type or endpoint is undocumented  \n**When** the API reference is reviewed  \n**Then** the gap is flagged before release  \n**And** the missing entry is added\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n## Post-MVP Backlog (Not in Scope for PRD FR1–FR28)\n\n### Epic 7: On-Call and Cross-Scope Scenarios Are Safe\n\nDefine and test safe escalation paths for shared-system and cross-tenant operations with strong audit and disclosure guarantees.\n\n\n**Given** the API reference is finalized  \n**When** documentation is published  \n**Then** the reference is available at `docs/api-reference.md` and referenced by a documentation test\n\n### Story 7.1: Define Explicit Shared-System Operations and Allowed Invariants\n\n**Implements:** N/A (post-MVP backlog)\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs an architect,\nI want shared-system scope to be explicit and bounded,\nSo that it cannot become a hidden wildcard.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** shared-system scope is used  \n**When** its allowed operations are reviewed  \n**Then** the allowed operations are explicit  \n**And** they are mapped to specific invariants and refusal rules\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a shared-system operation violates scope rules  \n**When** enforcement is evaluated  \n**Then** the operation is refused  \n**And** the refusal is standardized and auditable\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n\n**Given** shared-system operations violate allowed invariants  \n**When** enforcement runs  \n**Then** the operation must refuse with an error\n\n### Story 7.2: Support Safe Cross-Tenant Administrative Workflows\n\n**Implements:** N/A (post-MVP backlog)\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs an on-call responder,\nI want cross-tenant workflows to be explicit and constrained,\nSo that urgent fixes do not weaken tenant isolation guarantees.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** a cross-tenant administrative operation is required  \n**When** it is executed without explicit break-glass and scope declaration  \n**Then** enforcement refuses the operation  \n**And** the refusal references the appropriate invariants\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a cross-tenant operation is explicitly authorized  \n**When** it proceeds  \n**Then** audit events capture cross-tenant markers and scope details  \n**And** disclosure policy is enforced for errors and logs\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n\n**Given** cross-tenant admin workflows are attempted without break-glass  \n**When** enforcement evaluates the operation  \n**Then** the operation must refuse with an error\n\n### Story 7.3: Provide an Optional Audit Sink Interface with Strong Defaults\n\n**Implements:** N/A (post-MVP backlog)\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs a compliance stakeholder,\nI want a clear audit integration point,\nSo that audit durability can be improved without coupling the core.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** the audit model  \n**When** I review extension seams  \n**Then** there is an optional audit sink interface  \n**And** the default behavior still emits contract-compliant structured events\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n**Given** a custom audit sink is provided  \n**When** audit events are emitted  \n**Then** required audit fields are preserved  \n**And** compliance tests can assert the audit contract is still satisfied\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n\n### Story 7.4: Add Compliance Tests for Enumeration Resistance and Tenant-Existence Oracle Protection\n\n**Implements:** N/A (post-MVP backlog)\n**Related NFRs:** N/A\n\nAs a security reviewer,\nI want the subtle leak cases covered,\nSo that “safe by default” holds under adversarial usage.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n\n**Given** sensitive disclosure conditions  \n**When** compliance tests run against refusal behaviors  \n**Then** tenant existence cannot be inferred from error differences  \n**And** disclosure policy is consistently applied\n\n**Given** attribution and scope rules are stressed across execution kinds  \n**When** compliance tests run  \n**Then** refusals remain standardized and correlated  \n**And** invariant identifiers remain stable and machine-meaningful\n**And** this is verified by a test  \n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Initialize Rubric Validation\n\n\"Beginning **Epic Quality Review** using the deterministic IR rubric (C/D/E/G).\nOnly findings that match the rubric are valid issues.\"\n\n### 2. Epic Independence (Rubric C - Critical)\n\n- Verify no epic depends on a higher-numbered epic.\n- Verify no story depends on a story in a higher-numbered epic.\n- Record any violations as **Critical** with exact references.\n\n### 3. Story Testability (Rubric D - Major)\n\nFor each story:\n- Confirm >=2 Given/When/Then acceptance criteria.\n- Each AC must include one measurable artifact keyword:\n  `test`, `log`, `response`, `error`, `event`, or `metric`.\n- If story is enforcement/guard related, confirm >=1 negative AC\n  containing `refuse`, `error`, `fail`, or `block`.\n\nRecord violations as **Major** with story IDs.\n\n### 4. Dependency Hygiene (Rubric E - Major)\n\n- Each epic must explicitly declare dependencies (list or `None`).\n- Check for circular dependencies across epics.\n\nRecord violations as **Major** with epic IDs.\n\n### 5. Documentation Requirements (Rubric G - Major)\n\n- Verify stories exist for: Trust Contract, Integration Guide,\n  Verification Guide, API Reference.\n- Each doc story must include an AC with an explicit location path\n  (e.g., `docs/trust-contract.md`).\n\nRecord violations as **Major** with story IDs.\n\n## REVIEW COMPLETION:\n\nAfter completing epic quality review:\n\n- Update {outputFile} with all rubric-based findings\n- Document specific rule violations with references\n- Provide actionable recommendations\n- Load {nextStepFile} for final readiness assessment\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nThis step executes autonomously. Load {nextStepFile} only after complete epic quality review is documented.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All epics validated against best practices\n- Every dependency checked and verified\n- Quality violations documented with examples\n- Clear remediation guidance provided\n- No compromise on standards enforcement\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Accepting technical epics as valid\n- Ignoring forward dependencies\n- Not verifying story sizing\n- Overlooking obvious violations\n\n**Master Rule:** Enforce best practices rigorously. Find all violations.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
