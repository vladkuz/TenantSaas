You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"03f96564502f22f63db3caab556f69e2274e0d80","branch":"master"}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->\n\n## Story\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a documented, repeatable project initialization step,\nso that the baseline starts from a supported .NET SDK template with known structure.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Given** the approved .NET SDK templates\n   **When** I initialize the repo\n   **Then** the solution, core library, and reference host are created from the documented template\n   **And** the initialization steps are written in the setup guide\n   **And** this is verified by a test\n2. **Given** the project is initialized\n   **When** a required template or dependency is missing\n   **Then** the setup guide provides a clear failure message and resolution steps\n   **And** this is verified by a test\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [ ] Bootstrap the monorepo from .NET SDK templates (AC: #1)\n  - [ ] Create solution `TenantSaas.sln` via `dotnet new sln -n TenantSaas`\n  - [ ] Create projects via SDK templates (net10.0):\n    - [ ] `TenantSaas.Core` (classlib)\n    - [ ] `TenantSaas.EfCore` (classlib)\n    - [ ] `TenantSaas.ContractTests` (xunit)\n    - [ ] `TenantSaas.Sample` (webapi)\n  - [ ] Add all projects to the solution via `dotnet sln TenantSaas.sln add ...`\n  - [ ] Ensure flat repo structure at root (no `src/` or `tests/` folders)\n  - [ ] Ensure sample host uses the default Minimal API template (no controllers)\n- [ ] Add repo-level config files required by architecture (AC: #1)\n  - [ ] Add `global.json` to pin .NET SDK version (see Latest Tech Information)\n  - [ ] Add `Directory.Build.props` to set `TargetFramework=net10.0`, enable nullable, and unify build settings\n  - [ ] Add `Directory.Build.targets` if needed for shared build hooks (can be empty stub for now)\n  - [ ] Add `.editorconfig` with baseline C# formatting (can be minimal for now)\n- [ ] Write setup guide in `README.md` (AC: #1, #2)\n  - [ ] Include prerequisites (exact .NET SDK version) and the `dotnet new` commands from architecture\n  - [ ] Include how to run a basic build/test after initialization\n  - [ ] Add explicit failure guidance for missing templates/dependencies (e.g., install SDK, run `dotnet new --install`)\n- [ ] Add verification tests in `TenantSaas.ContractTests` (AC: #1, #2)\n  - [ ] Test that `README.md` includes the required initialization commands\n  - [ ] Test that `README.md` includes a clear missing-template/dependency resolution section\n  - [ ] Use xUnit + FluentAssertions\n\n## Developer Context\n\n- This story bootstraps the repo using .NET SDK templates only; no domain logic yet.\n- The output must align with the architecture's starter template and project structure.\n- Keep changes minimal, focused on initialization + documentation + verification tests.\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n- Target framework: `net10.0` for all generated projects.\n- Use .NET SDK `dotnet new` templates; do not introduce extra scaffolding or frameworks.\n- Keep initialization deterministic and reproducible via documented commands.\n\n## Architecture Compliance\n\n- Use the exact `dotnet new` command sequence documented in architecture.\n- Keep API sample Minimal API (no controllers).\n- Keep repo flat (no `src/` or `tests/` directories).\n\n## Library / Framework Requirements\n\n- Testing: xUnit + FluentAssertions (use in ContractTests).\n- API docs: Swashbuckle remains planned; do not add in this story unless template includes it.\n- Optional telemetry stays optional; do not add OpenTelemetry packages in this story.\n\n## File Structure Requirements\n\n- Root-level solution and projects only.\n- Required root config files: `global.json`, `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, `.editorconfig`.\n- Do not add new projects beyond the four in the starter command list for this story.\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Use xUnit + FluentAssertions for all tests.\n- Tests must be deterministic and not rely on external tooling.\n- Tests should validate documentation content (setup guide and failure guidance).\n\n## Latest Tech Information\n\n- .NET SDK: use latest 10.0.x LTS SDK for `global.json` (currently 10.0.102 per .NET 10 SDK release info).\n- EF Core: architecture expects EF Core 10 (LTS) with .NET 10; no EF Core packages are added in this story.\n- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore: architecture pins 10.1.0; do not upgrade/downgrade here.\n- OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting: architecture pins 1.15.0; do not add in this story.\n- OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol: verify latest package version before adding; architecture expects 1.15.0.\n\nExternal references (for version verification):\n- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-10.0/whatsnew\n- https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/10.1.0\n- https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting/1.15.0\n- https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol\n\n## Project Context Reference\n\n- Follow project context rules in `_bmad-output/project-context.md` (naming, async, logging, tests, error handling, repo structure).\n\n## Story Completion Status\n\n- Status set to `ready-for-dev` once this story file is created and sprint status updated.\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n- The architecture mandates .NET SDK default templates as the starter; follow the exact `dotnet new` commands defined there.\n- Keep the API host minimal; do not add controllers or additional frameworks in this story.\n- Do not add extra projects beyond the four in the starter template for this story (even though the architecture later adds `TenantSaas.Abstractions`).\n- No new dependencies beyond those produced by the templates are allowed in this story.\n- Ensure all project TFMs are `net10.0`.\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Required flat structure with root-level projects and config files.\n- Project tree target is defined in architecture; this story only bootstraps the initial set of projects and root config files.\n- Any deviations from the starter commands must be documented in `README.md` with rationale.\n\n### References\n\n- Epics: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` (Epic 1, Story 1.1)\n- Architecture: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (Starter Template Evaluation, Project Structure)\n- PRD: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md` (FR14, FR21)\n- Project Context: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nGPT-5 Codex\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- Git: recent commits reviewed (`git log -5 --oneline`)\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Ultimate context engine analysis completed - comprehensive developer guide created\n\n### File List\n\n- `TenantSaas.sln`\n- `TenantSaas.Core/TenantSaas.Core.csproj`\n- `TenantSaas.EfCore/TenantSaas.EfCore.csproj`\n- `TenantSaas.ContractTests/TenantSaas.ContractTests.csproj`\n- `TenantSaas.Sample/TenantSaas.Sample.csproj`\n- `global.json`\n- `Directory.Build.props`\n- `Directory.Build.targets`\n- `.editorconfig`\n- `README.md`\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- .NET 10 (all projects target net10.0)\n- EF Core 10 (reference adapter)\n- SQLite (reference datastore, abstracted)\n- Minimal APIs (sample host)\n- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore 10.1.0 (Swagger)\n- OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting 1.15.0 (optional)\n- OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol 1.15.0 (optional)\n- xUnit (contract tests)\n- Problem Details (RFC 7807)\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules (C#/.NET)\n\n- Use standard .NET naming (PascalCase types/methods, camelCase locals/fields).\n- No underscore prefixes anywhere.\n- Prefer `async`/`await` and `Task`-returning APIs; avoid `.Result`/`.Wait()`.\n- Always pass `CancellationToken` in async methods.\n- Use primary constructors where possible; avoid them only when not viable.\n- Use DI extension methods for service registration.\n- Business logic lives in services; none in controllers.\n- Services call repositories for data access; no data access elsewhere.\n- Use nullable reference types and explicit nullability where applicable.\n- Use exceptions for truly exceptional control flow; prefer explicit result types for invariant violations.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules (ASP.NET Core / EF Core)\n\n- Use Minimal APIs for the sample host.\n- Controllers (if any) must be thin; all business logic stays in services.\n- EF Core access only through repositories; no direct `DbContext` use outside.\n- Enforce tenant invariants in `SaveChanges` guard only.\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n- Use xUnit for all tests.\n- Use FluentAssertions for assertions.\n- Use Moq for mocking where needed.\n- Tests must run in strict mode everywhere.\n- Contract tests live in `TenantSaas.ContractTests` only (no test subfolders).\n- Tests must assert invariant violations via Problem Details shape + `invariant_code`.\n- Avoid mocks in contract tests when feasible; prefer real EF Core + SQLite fixtures.\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`; no underscores.\n- Date/time is ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 UTC with `Z` only.\n- Problem Details only for errors; direct resource for success.\n- Structured logs must include required fields (`tenant_id`, `trace_id`, `request_id`, `invariant_code`, `event_name`, `severity`).\n- Use `invariant_code` (string) over GUID-like IDs.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n- Keep flat repo structure (no `src/`, no `tests/` folders).\n- Use `Directory.Build.props/targets` for shared build config.\n- CI in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, release on tags.\n- Use `scripts/` for build/test/pack scripts.\n\n### Critical Don’t-Miss Rules\n\n- Never access persistence outside repositories.\n- Never execute a query that is not tenant-scoped.\n- Never bypass tenant context or invariant guards.\n- Never throw or surface raw exceptions across API boundaries.\n- Never return non-Problem Details error responses.\n- Never use HTTP 200 for error conditions.\n- Never emit non-UTC timestamps or timestamps without `Z`.\n- Never log without required structured fields.\n- Never log secrets, credentials, tokens, or PII.\n- Never introduce non-deterministic behavior without explicit justification.\n- Never introduce new dependencies without explicit justification.\n- Never perform side effects outside designated adapters.\n- Never use implicit or ambiguous route parameters (e.g., `{id}`).\n- Never introduce breaking API changes without explicit versioning.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n- Read this file before implementing any code.\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented.\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option.\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge.\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs.\n- Update when the technology stack changes.\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules.\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time.\n\nLast Updated: 2026-01-25T13:34:50-08:00\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe FRs define a strict tenant-context model with explicit attribution, a small invariant set (<=7), and uniform enforcement across request, background, admin, and scripted paths. A single unavoidable integration point must initialize and propagate context. The baseline must refuse ambiguous actions and surface explicit refusal reasons. Verification artifacts (contract tests) are first-class deliverables and must be runnable by adopters in CI. Documentation is part of the core contract: a concise conceptual model, explicit trust contract, integration guide, and full API reference. Extension points are allowed only through sanctioned boundaries that preserve invariants; bypass paths are explicitly blocked and tested. Onboarding requirements emphasize discoverability and actionable errors.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nSecurity and correctness dominate: 100% rejection of ambiguous attribution, explicit privileged action gating, deterministic enforcement, and zero silent fallbacks. Reliability requires consistent behavior across execution contexts and repeated runs. Integration must be unavoidable and non-invasive to domain logic, with contract tests catching bypasses. Performance and scalability targets are tight (low latency overhead, no default background loops, invariants hold under scale).\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nComplexity is medium-to-high due to safety guarantees, cross-context enforcement, and proof requirements.\n\n- Primary domain: backend/platform developer tool (multi-tenant SaaS baseline)\n- Complexity level: medium-to-high\n- Estimated architectural components: 6-8 (core context model, enforcement engine, integration boundary, context propagation, contract tests, docs/contract, sample integration, packaging/distribution)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- MVP language: .NET; secondary npm distribution for tooling/examples.\n- No end-user UI; UX work limited to developer ergonomics, docs flow, and error messaging.\n- Small, stable API surface; invariants must be non-bypassable.\n- Single unavoidable integration point for all execution paths.\n- Contract tests are mandatory and must be CI-ready.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Tenant attribution as a hard requirement across all paths.\n- Explicit refusal behavior and error guidance.\n- Privilege elevation with explicit intent and auditability.\n- Deterministic enforcement and proof via contract tests.\n- Performance overhead limits and predictable behavior under scale.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nBackend/platform developer tool (multi-tenant SaaS baseline) based on the project requirements.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n**.NET SDK default templates (`dotnet new`)**  \nVerified on Microsoft Learn as the current, maintained templates that ship with the .NET SDK (solution, class library, xUnit, web API).\n\nRationale: Minimal, unopinionated scaffolding that fits a trust-kernel library and avoids unnecessary framework assumptions.\n\n### Selected Starter: .NET SDK default templates (monorepo baseline)\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\n- Aligns with .NET-first MVP and a minimal, invariant-focused core.\n- Keeps surface area small and avoids architectural bias.\n- Provides contract-test scaffolding (xUnit) and a reference host (web API) without dictating runtime architecture.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\ndotnet new sln -n TenantSaas\n\ndotnet new classlib -n TenantSaas.Core -f net10.0\ndotnet new classlib -n TenantSaas.EfCore -f net10.0\ndotnet new xunit -n TenantSaas.ContractTests -f net10.0\ndotnet new webapi -n TenantSaas.Sample -f net10.0\n\ndotnet sln TenantSaas.sln add \\\n  TenantSaas.Core/TenantSaas.Core.csproj \\\n  TenantSaas.EfCore/TenantSaas.EfCore.csproj \\\n  TenantSaas.ContractTests/TenantSaas.ContractTests.csproj \\\n  TenantSaas.Sample/TenantSaas.Sample.csproj\n```\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\n- .NET 10 target framework for all projects.\n\n**Build Tooling:**\n- Standard .NET SDK build pipeline and solution structure.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\n- xUnit scaffold for contract tests.\n\n**Code Organization:**\n- Monorepo with separate projects for core, contract tests, and sample host.\n\n**Development Experience:**\n- Standard SDK CLI workflows; no added tooling assumptions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- .NET 10 monorepo baseline with storage-agnostic core and reference adapters.\n- Tenant context + invariant enforcement in core; EF Core and TenantFence-style patterns are reference implementations only.\n- Refuse-by-default enforcement with strictly constrained break-glass path.\n- Contract tests as first-class verification artifacts.\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- REST Minimal APIs for sample host.\n- Swagger endpoint docs + minimal handwritten guidance.\n- Problem Details (RFC 7807) as the sole error format.\n- BYO-auth stance with runnable API key sample.\n- Structured logging with optional OpenTelemetry hooks.\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Packaging strategy (NuGet layout, multi-package split).\n- Distributed caching (Redis, etc.).\n- Auth provider integrations (OIDC/other).\n- Rate limiting implementation.\n- Production infrastructure templates.\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Core library:** Storage-agnostic; no EF Core dependency.\n- **Datastore (reference/sample):** SQLite (abstracted).\n- **Reference persistence adapter:** EF Core (current 10.0) in sample/reference only.\n- **Modeling approach (reference/sample):** `CurrentTenant` scope + `TenantDbContext` SaveChanges guard (TenantFence-style).\n- **Caching:** In-memory only, abstracted behind interface.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth in sample:** Simple API key (runnable) + official BYO-auth stance.\n- **Authorization pattern:** Thin, tenant-scoped guard/policy module portable across HTTP/jobs/scripts.\n- **Middleware posture:** Refuse-by-default with optional, strictly constrained break-glass path.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST Minimal APIs.\n- **API docs:** Swagger (Swashbuckle.AspNetCore 10.1.0) + minimal handwritten guidance (non-duplicative).\n- **Errors:** Problem Details (RFC 7807) only.\n- **Rate limiting:** Documented recommendation only (no implementation).\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- Not applicable (no UI).\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Sample hosting:** `dotnet run` + Dockerfile (optional docker-compose).\n- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions build/test/pack; release on tags.\n- **Observability:** Core defines logging interfaces and enrichers; optional OpenTelemetry hooks (OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting 1.15.0, OTLP exporter 1.15.0) demonstrated in the sample host.\n- **Scaling:** Docs-first with “known failure modes” and recommended patterns; no infra implementation.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1) Define tenant context + policy guard contract (core).\n2) Implement EF Core `TenantDbContext` SaveChanges guard (reference adapter).\n3) Add contract tests (xUnit) for invariants and refusal behavior.\n4) Add sample host (Minimal API) with API key auth and Problem Details.\n5) Add Swagger docs + minimal guidance.\n6) Add logging hooks; optional OTel example.\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Contract tests depend on core invariants and EF Core adapter.\n- Sample host depends on policy guard and error handling standard.\n- Logging/observability hooks must wrap guard/tenant context to preserve traceability.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\nNaming, structure, API formats, error handling, logging fields, and date/time formatting.\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables and columns use `PascalCase` to align with EF Core defaults (e.g., `TenantId`, `CreatedAt`).\n- No underscore prefixes anywhere.\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints are plural nouns: `/tenants`, `/invariants`, `/contexts`.\n- Route parameters are explicit: `/tenants/{tenantId}` (never `{id}`).\n- Query parameters are `camelCase` (e.g., `includeDeleted`).\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Standard .NET naming: PascalCase types/methods, camelCase locals/fields.\n- No underscore prefixes anywhere.\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Flat root structure (no `src/` or `tests/` folders).\n- Per-project `*.Tests` projects only (no tests subfolder).\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- Shared utilities live in `TenantSaas.Core/Common`.\n- Samples live under dedicated `TenantSaas.Sample` project.\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Success responses return direct resource payloads (no `{data, error}` envelope).\n- Errors use Problem Details only.\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Date/time values are ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 UTC strings with `Z` suffix only.\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**Event Naming (if applicable):**\n- `event_name` is lowercase, dot-separated (e.g., `tenant.resolve_failed`).\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Use RFC 7807 Problem Details with fixed fields: `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `instance`.\n- Extensions: `invariant_code`, `trace_id`, `tenant_ref` (only when safe), and `errors` for validation.\n- Tenant disclosure policy: include `tenant_ref` in Problem Details only when the caller is authenticated/authorized for that tenant and disclosure is not an enumeration risk; otherwise omit it.\n- Definition: `tenant_ref` is the disclosure-safe tenant identifier used in logs/errors. It is either an opaque public tenant ID or a safe-state token (`unknown`, `sensitive`, `cross_tenant`) when disclosure is unsafe; it must not be a raw internal ID or a reversible identifier.\n- `type` is stable and machine-meaningful (URN or URL).\n- `detail` must never leak internals or secrets.\n- For 500s, use generic title/detail with `trace_id` + `invariant_code`.\n- HTTP mapping discipline: 401/403 auth, 404 not found, 409 conflict, 422 semantic validation (if used), 429 rate limit, 500+ server faults.\n- For validation, use `ValidationProblemDetails` and include `invariant_code`.\n\n**Logging Patterns:**\n- Structured logs with a tight, consistent field set.\n- Required fields: `tenant_ref`, `trace_id`, `request_id`, `invariant_code`, `event_name`, `severity`.\n- Optional fields: `span_id`, `user_id`, `route`, `endpoint`, `http_method`, `status_code`, `duration_ms`, `client_id`.\n- Prefer `invariant_code` (string) over GUID-like IDs.\n- Provide a minimal log enricher helper (e.g., `TenantLogEnricher`) and/or middleware.\n- Do not hard-depend on a specific logging stack beyond `ILogger`.\n- Tenant reference states for logs:\n  - `tenant_ref = <opaque tenant id>` when safe to disclose.\n  - `tenant_ref = \"unknown\"` when unresolved.\n  - `tenant_ref = \"sensitive\"` when resolved but unsafe to disclose.\n  - `tenant_ref = \"cross_tenant\"` for admin/global operations.\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Use explicit route parameters (e.g., `{tenantId}`) and plural endpoints.\n- Emit Problem Details for all errors with `invariant_code`.\n- Log required fields on every request-related log line, using `tenant_ref` semantics.\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- Contract tests validate error shape, required log fields, and date/time formats.\n- Pattern violations are documented in the architecture decision doc and corrected in PRs.\n- Updates to patterns require updating this section and tests.\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Route: `GET /tenants/{tenantId}`\n- Problem Details `type`: `urn:tenantfence:error:tenant-not-found`\n- Log: `event_name=tenant.resolve_failed`, `tenant_ref=...`, `trace_id=...`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Route: `/tenant/{id}` or `/Tenant`\n- Error envelope: `{ data, error }`\n- Dates: local time strings or missing `Z` suffix\n- Logs without `trace_id` or `invariant_code`\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\nTenantSaas/\n├── README.md\n├── docs/\n│   ├── architecture.md\n│   ├── trust-contract.md\n│

External API is only in `TenantSaas.Sample` (Minimal APIs).\n- Authentication boundary is in `TenantSaas.Sample/Auth` with API key handler.\n- Error boundary is enforced via Problem Details middleware.\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n- `TenantSaas.Abstractions` defines contracts and shared types only.\n- `TenantSaas.Core` implements invariant enforcement and logging helpers.\n- `TenantSaas.EfCore` provides the reference EF Core adapter only.\n- Contract tests target abstractions, core behavior, and reference adapters as needed; no sample coupling.\n\n**Service Boundaries:**\n- No internal services; the library remains a single trust-kernel.\n- Sample host is a thin integration example only.\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n- EF Core integration contained in `TenantSaas.EfCore/EfCore`.\n- Tenant context resolution is in `TenantSaas.Core/Tenancy`, accessed via abstractions.\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**FR Categories → Locations:**\n- Tenant context model → `TenantSaas.Abstractions/Tenancy` + `TenantSaas.Core/Tenancy`\n- Invariant enforcement/refusal → `TenantSaas.Core/Enforcement`\n- Integration point → `TenantSaas.Sample/Middleware` + `TenantSaas.Core/Tenancy`\n- Verification artifacts → `TenantSaas.ContractTests`\n- Trust contract/docs → `docs/`\n\n**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**\n- Error handling → `TenantSaas.Core/Errors` + `TenantSaas.Sample/Middleware`\n- Logging → `TenantSaas.Abstractions/Logging` + `TenantSaas.Core/Logging`\n- Break-glass → `TenantSaas.Core/Enforcement/BreakGlassPolicy.cs`\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal Communication:**\n- Sample host consumes `TenantSaas.Core` + `TenantSaas.Abstractions`.\n- Contract tests reference `TenantSaas.Core` and `TenantSaas.Abstractions`.\n\n**External Integrations:**\n- API key auth (sample only) is replaceable; BYO-auth stance in docs.\n\n**Data Flow:**\n- Request → API key auth → tenant context middleware → invariant guard → reference adapter (EF Core in sample).\n\n### File Organization Patterns\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n- Root-level `Directory.Build.props/targets`, `global.json`, `.editorconfig`.\n- Sample config in `TenantSaas.Sample/appsettings*.json`.\n\n**Source Organization:**\n- Abstractions contain contracts only; Core contains invariant enforcement and shared logic; reference adapters live in separate packages (e.g., `TenantSaas.EfCore`).\n\n**Test Organization:**\n- Contract tests in `TenantSaas.ContractTests` only (no test subfolders).\n\n**Asset Organization:**\n- Docker assets under `docker/`.\n- Docs under `docs/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Integration\n\n**Development Server Structure:**\n- `dotnet run` from `TenantSaas.Sample` or Docker via `docker/sample.Dockerfile`.\n\n**Build Process Structure:**\n- Solution-wide build via `dotnet build TenantSaas.sln`.\n\n**Deployment Structure:**\n- Sample API containerized for demo; library shipped via NuGet (packaging deferred).\n\n## Architecture Validation Results\n\n### Coherence Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Compatibility:**\nAll technology choices are compatible: .NET 10 + EF Core 10, Minimal APIs, Problem Details, and Swashbuckle align without conflict.\n\n**Pattern Consistency:**\nNaming, format, and logging patterns align with the stack and enforceable invariants.\n\n**Structure Alignment:**\nProject structure cleanly separates abstractions, core enforcement, samples, and tests.\n\n### Requirements Coverage Validation ✅\n\n**Epic/Feature Coverage:**\nNo epics provided; FR

addressed via enforcement design and contract tests.\n\n### Implementation Readiness Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Completeness:**\nCritical decisions documented with versions and rationale.\n\n**Structure Completeness:**\nFull project tree defined with boundaries and integration points.\n\n**Pattern Completeness:**\nPatterns specified for naming, errors, logging, dates, and

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
