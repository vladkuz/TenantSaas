You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"b7687f9ce9e4bcba7a2ab893bd6b8090642aa6bf","branch":"master"}}}

Uses adversarial review approach to find gaps and issues.'\nweb_bundle: false\n---\n\n# Implementation Readiness\n\n**Goal:** Validate that PRD, Architecture, Epics and Stories are complete and aligned before Phase 4 implementation starts, with a focus on ensuring epics and stories are logical and have accounted for all requirements and planning.\n\n**Your Role:** You are an expert Product Manager and Scrum Master, renowned and respected in the field of requirements traceability and spotting gaps in planning. Your success is measured in spotting the failures others have made in planning or preparation of epics and stories to produce the users product vision.\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step of the overall goal is a self contained instruction file that you will adhere too 1 file as directed at a time\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only 1 current step file will be loaded, read, and executed to completion - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Module Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`\n- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nLoad, read the full file and then execute `./step-01-document-discovery.md` to begin the workflow.\n"}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Initialize Document Discovery\n\n\"Beginning **Document Discovery** to inventory all project files.\n\nI will:\n\n1. Search for all required documents (PRD, Architecture, Epics, UX)\n2. Group sharded documents together\n3. Identify any duplicates (whole + sharded versions)\n4. Present findings for your confirmation\"\n\n### 2. Document Search Patterns\n\nSearch for each document type using these patterns:\n\n#### A. PRD Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### B. Architecture Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### C. Epics & Stories Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### D. UX Design Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/index.md` and related files\n\n### 3. Organize Findings\n\nFor each document type found:\n\n```\n## [Document Type] Files Found\n\n**Whole Documents:**\n- [filename.md] ([size], [modified date])\n\n**Sharded Documents:**\n- Folder: [foldername]/\n  - index.md\n  - [other files in folder]\n```\n\n### 4. Identify Critical Issues\n\n#### Duplicates (CRITICAL)\n\nIf both whole and sharded versions exist:\n\n```\n⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: Duplicate document formats found\n- PRD exists as both whole.md AND prd/ folder\n- YOU MUST choose which version to use\n- Remove or rename the other version to avoid confusion\n```\n\n#### Missing Documents (WARNING)\n\nIf required documents not found:\n\n```\n⚠️ WARNING: Required document not found\n- Architecture document not found\n- Will impact assessment completeness\n```\n\n### 5. Add Initial Report Section\n\nInitialize {outputFile} with {templateFile}.\n\n### 6. Present Findings and Get Confirmation\n\nDisplay findings and ask:\n\"**Document Discovery Complete**\n\n[Show organized file list]\n\n**Issues Found:**\n\n- [List any duplicates requiring resolution]\n- [List any missing documents]\n\n**Required Actions:**\n\n- If duplicates exist: Please remove/rename one version\n- Confirm which documents to use for assessment\n\n**Ready to proceed?** [C] Continue after resolving issues\"\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: **Select an Option:** [C] Continue to File Validation\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed with 'C' selection\n- If duplicates identified, insist on resolution first\n- User can clarify file locations or request additional searches\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Save document inventory to {outputFile}, update frontmatter with completed step and files being included, and only then load read fully and execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then redisplay menu\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN C is selected and document inventory is saved will you load {nextStepFile} to begin file validation.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All document types searched systematically\n- Files organized and inventoried clearly\n- Duplicates identified and flagged for resolution\n- User confirmed file selections\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not searching all document types\n- Ignoring duplicate document conflicts\n- Proceeding without resolving critical issues\n- Not saving document inventory\n\n**Master Rule:** Clear file identification is essential for accurate assessment.\n"}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path).

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

UX marked not applicable.\n\n## PRD Analysis\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nFR1: Platform engineers can define the canonical tenant identity model used across the system.  \nFR2: The system can represent tenant scope and shared-system scope as explicit, distinct contexts.  \nFR3: The system can represent a no tenant state only when explicitly justified by the trust contract.  \nFR4: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.  \nFR5: The baseline model can be referenced as a single source of truth by services integrating it.  \nFR6: The system can refuse operations with ambiguous or missing tenant attribution.  \nFR7: The system can enforce an explicit invariant set of <=7 invariants defined and enumerated in the trust contract.  \nFR8: Invariant enforcement applies uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths.  \nFR9: The system can surface refusal reasons explicitly to developers when invariants are violated.  \nFR10: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent and cannot proceed silently.  \nFR11: The system provides a single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context initialization.  \nFR12: The integration point can propagate tenant context to downstream operations consistently.  \nFR13: The integration point can reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent.  \nFR14: Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold.  \nFR15: The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement.  \nFR16: Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence.  \nFR17: Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package.  \nFR18: Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts.  \nFR19: The system provides a conceptual model describing tenancy, scope, and shared-system context in <=800 words or <=2 pages.  \nFR20: The system provides an explicit trust contract that defines invariants and refusal behavior.  \nFR21: The system provides an integration guide with <=6 required steps and a reference setup time <=30 minutes.  \nFR22: The system provides a verification guide that explains how to run and interpret contract tests.  \nFR23: The system provides an API reference that covers 100% of public surface area and lists all public types/entry points.  \nFR24: The system defines explicit boundaries where extensions may be built without weakening invariants.  \nFR25: Adapters can integrate through sanctioned boundaries while preserving the trust contract.  \nFR26: The core surface blocks bypass paths by restricting entry points to sanctioned boundaries, verified by contract tests covering 100% of public entry points.  \nFR27: New engineers can locate the trust contract and run contract tests within 60 minutes using the docs alone.  \nFR28: 100% of refusal errors include actionable guidance and a link to the relevant contract rule, verified by contract tests.  \n\nTotal FRs: 28\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\nNFR1: The system shall reject 100% of operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution as measured by contract tests covering request, background, and admin paths.  \nNFR2: Privileged or cross-scope actions shall require explicit scope declaration and justification fields, verified by contract tests for all privileged operations.  \nNFR3: The system shall produce zero silent fallbacks when required context is missing, verified by negative tests in CI.  \nNFR4: Security-relevant behavior shall be covered by contract tests with >=90% branch coverage in the enforcement module, measured in CI.  \nNFR5: Invariant enforcement shall be deterministic across 10 repeated CI runs with identical inputs yielding identical outcomes (0 variance).  \nNFR6: Failure modes shall return explicit error codes/messages for 100% of invariant violations, verified by contract tests.  \nNFR7: Invariant check failures shall return within <=100ms at p95 in reference benchmarks.  \nNFR8: Core guarantees shall pass the same contract tests across local and CI environments with 0 environment-specific skips.  \nNFR9: All request paths shall pass through the single integration point in the reference project, verified by tracing tests with 100% coverage.  \nNFR10: Integration shall require no changes to domain/business logic in the reference project (0 files under domain namespaces modified), verified by sample diff.  \nNFR11: The integration guide shall include a full wiring example and complete successfully in <=30 minutes for a new service, measured in onboarding trials.  \nNFR12: If the integration point is removed or bypassed, contract tests shall fail in CI with a specific error within a single test run.  \nNFR13: Baseline overhead shall add <=1ms at p95 per request in a reference benchmark of 10,000 requests.  \nNFR14: Enforcement checks shall add <=5% latency when tenant count scales from 1 to 10,000, measured by benchmark.  \nNFR15: The baseline shall start zero background polling loops or timers by default, verified by runtime inspection tests.  \nNFR16: Contract tests shall pass with tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000 in load simulations.  \nNFR17: Reference architecture shall demonstrate multi-service and multi-database topology without special casing, verified by documented example and integration test.  \nNFR18: All invariants shall remain enforced under 10x load compared to baseline, verified by load tests.  \nNFR19: Accessibility not applicable; TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.  \n\nTotal NFRs: 19\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- UX documentation is not required for this project.  \n- MVP support: .NET.  \n- Secondary distribution: npm package (for complementary tooling or examples).  \n- Out of scope for MVP: other runtimes/languages.  \n"}}

Initialize PRD Analysis\n\n\"Beginning **PRD Analysis** to extract all requirements.\n\nI will:\n\n1. Load the PRD document (whole or sharded)\n2. Read it completely and thoroughly\n3. Extract ALL Functional Requirements (FRs)\n4. Extract ALL Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n5. Document findings for coverage validation\"\n\n### 2. Load and Read PRD\n\nFrom the document inventory in step 1:\n\n- If whole PRD file exists: Load and read it completely\n- If sharded PRD exists: Load and read ALL files in the PRD folder\n- Ensure complete coverage - no files skipped\n\n### 3. Extract Functional Requirements (FRs)\n\nSearch for and extract:\n\n- Numbered FRs (FR1, FR2, FR3, etc.)\n- Requirements labeled \"Functional Requirement\"\n- User stories or use cases that represent functional needs\n- Business rules that must be implemented\n\nFormat findings as:\n\n```\n## Functional Requirements Extracted\n\nFR1: [Complete requirement text]\nFR2: [Complete requirement text]\nFR3: [Complete requirement text]\n...\nTotal FRs: [count]\n```\n\n### 4. Extract Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n\nSearch for and extract:\n\n- Performance requirements (response times, throughput)\n- Security requirements (authentication, encryption, etc.)\n- Usability requirements (accessibility, ease of use)\n- Reliability requirements (uptime, error rates)\n- Scalability requirements (concurrent users, data growth)\n- Compliance requirements (standards, regulations)\n\nFormat findings as:\n\n```\n## Non-Functional Requirements Extracted\n\nNFR1: [Performance requirement]\nNFR2: [Security requirement]\nNFR3: [Usability requirement]\n...\nTotal NFRs: [count]\n```\n\n### 5. Document Additional Requirements\n\nLook for:\n\n- Constraints or assumptions\n- Technical requirements not labeled as FR/NFR\n- Business constraints\n- Integration requirements\n\n### 6. Add to Assessment Report\n\nAppend to {outputFile}:\n\n```markdown\n## PRD Analysis\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n[Complete FR list from section 3]\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n[Complete NFR list from section 4]\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n[Any other requirements or constraints found]\n\n### PRD Completeness Assessment\n\n[Initial assessment of PRD completeness and clarity]\n```\n\n### 7. Auto-Proceed to Next Step\n\nAfter PRD analysis complete, immediately load next step for epic coverage validation.\n\n## PROCEEDING TO EPIC COVERAGE VALIDATION\n\nPRD analysis complete. Loading next step to validate epic coverage.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- PRD loaded and read completely\n- All FRs extracted with full text\n- All NFRs identified and documented\n- Findings added to assessment report\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not reading complete PRD (especially sharded versions)\n- Missing requirements in extraction\n- Summarizing instead of extracting full text\n- Not documenting findings in report\n\n**Master Rule:** Complete requirement extraction is essential for traceability validation.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It targets platform engineers, founders, and security reviewers who need explicit, verifiable guarantees rather than framework-driven scaffolding. Differentiation comes from invariant-first design, explicit refusal behavior, and runnable contract tests that prove guarantees hold across execution paths.\n\n**Problem Statement:** Multi-tenant systems routinely allow actions with ambiguous tenant scope or authority, creating latent cross-tenant risks that are only discovered after incidents.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\nThe primary \"aha\" is a posture shift: teams stop debating multi-tenant assumptions because the baseline makes them obvious.\n\nPrimary signals:\n- New services/features fit cleanly into the baseline without redesign.\n- Developers hit constraints early and think \"good - this would have been messy later.\"\n- The trust contract is treated as the default, not a suggestion.\n\nSecondary signals:\n- Dangerous operations are surfaced explicitly instead of silently allowed.\n- New engineers can learn tenancy from code, not Slack history.\n\n**Metrics (6 months):**\n- >=3 new services integrate TenantSaas within 2 sprints of project start.\n- >=80% of new multi-tenant features ship without baseline redesign.\n- >=90% of services keep the baseline enabled after initial adoption.\n- New engineer onboarding to tenancy concepts takes <=1 day using docs + contract tests.\n\n### Business Success\n\n**~3 months (validation):**\n- Integrated into >=3 real (non-demo) projects.\n- >=50% of integrations happen at project start (greenfield).\n- >=70% of adopters keep it after initial experimentation.\n- >=3 feedback items explicitly reference it as a \"baseline\" or \"foundation.\"\n- >=2 internal docs or architecture notes cite it.\nValidation: the right users take it seriously and keep it.\n\n**~12 months (traction):**\n- Repeat usage by >=2 teams across >=2 projects each.\n- Annual retention >=80% among adopters.\n- >=3 external or internal mentions in blogs, architecture forums, or platform standards.\n- >=5 pull-through requests for examples/extensions/integrations (not core expansion).\n- >=2 teams describe it as infrastructure they would not remove without concern.\nValidation: it is treated as infrastructure, not a trial tool.\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Core invariants are enforced through unavoidable integration points.\n- Ambiguous or unattributed operations are refused by default.\n- Contract/verification tests exist, are runnable by adopters, and are executed in CI.\n- The core API surface stays small, stable, and resists ad-hoc extension.\n- Behavior is consistent across request paths, background execution, and admin/scripted usage.\nTechnical success = guarantees hold even as usage patterns expand.\n\n**Metrics (technical):**\n- 100% of defined invariants are enforced by contract tests across request, background, and admin paths.\n- Contract test suite runs in CI in <=10 minutes on reference projects.\n- Zero P0/P1 incidents caused by tenant-scope violations in adopter projects during first 6 months.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Multiple real projects integrate TenantSaas, with at least some greenfield starts.\n- Retention after initial experimentation (kept in place).\n- Documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- Contract tests running in CI across adopters.\n- Repeat adoption across projects by the same teams.\n\n**Metrics (measurable outcomes):**\n- >=3 real integrations, with >=1 greenfield.\n- >=70% retention after initial experimentation.\n- >=2 documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- >=2 adopters running contract tests in CI.\n- >=2 repeat adoptions by the same team/org.\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Explicit baseline model for multi-tenant SaaS.\n- One or more enforced invariants that remove ambiguity early.\n- A single unavoidable integration point anchoring the baseline.\n- Verification mechanism (tests/assertions) that proves rules hold.\n- Documentation that explains the model and contract (not features).\n- UX documentation is not required for this project.\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Optional extensions/adapters.\n- Reference implementations or example apps.\n- Additional verification/reporting hooks.\n- Integration patterns for common tooling.\n- Better ergonomics around configuration and visibility.\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Recognized baseline for serious multi-tenant systems.\n- Core remains small and conservative.\n- Innovation primarily in extensions/examples/ecosystem contributions.\n- Shapes how teams think about SaaS foundations, not just scaffolding.\n- Referenced as a trust kernel, not marketed as a framework.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### 1) Platform engineer integrating TenantSaas into a new service\n\n**Opening scene:** Maya owns platform standards and is starting a new service in a growing SaaS stack. She is wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.\n**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.\n**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution. It forces a decision at design time, not after launch.\n**Resolution:** Maya adopts the trust contract as a shared team standard. The new service fits into existing architecture without special cases, and future services reuse the same baseline without re-debate.\n\n### 2) On-call responder using elevated scope during an incident (edge case)\n\n**Opening scene:** Jordan is on call when a cross-tenant data correction is required under time pressure.\n**Rising action:** Jordan attempts a privileged operation; the system requires explicit scope elevation with clear intent, not silent admin access.\n**Climax:** The system allows the operation only through a constrained path that is visible and auditable, avoiding accidental overreach.\n**Resolution:** The fix is applied quickly without bypassing the baseline. The incident is resolved and the audit trail is clean, with no special exceptions introduced.\n\n### 3) Founder / early builder adopting at project start\n\n**Opening scene:** Priya is starting a new SaaS product and wants to avoid fixing multi-tenancy later.\n**Rising action:** She adds TenantSaas early because it is small, explicit, and does not prescribe a full framework.\n**Climax:** The baseline forces clarity around tenant context at the first integration point, and Priya realizes she does not need to invent her own conventions.\n**Resolution:** The team moves fast with confidence, knowing the core assumptions are locked in without slowing momentum.\n\n### 4) Security/compliance stakeholder reviewing guarantees\n\n**Opening scene:** Alex is asked to assess tenant isolation guarantees before an external review.\n**Rising action:** Alex inspects the trust contract and verification artifacts rather than chasing tribal knowledge.\n**Climax:** The evidence shows invariants enforced at unavoidable choke points, with contract tests that can be executed in CI.\n**Resolution:** Alex can approve the baseline as a credible control, because the guarantees are explicit and verifiable, not implied.\n\n### 5) API/integration contributor extending or adapting the core\n\n**Opening scene:** Sam wants to create an adapter for a different stack while keeping the core intact.\n**Rising action:** Sam reviews the constraints and sees where extensions are allowed versus where invariants are non-negotiable.\n**Climax:** The adapter integrates through the sanctioned boundary and inherits the same guarantees without widening the core API.\n**Resolution:** The extension adds reach without fragmenting the baseline, and the core remains intentionally small.\n\n### 6) New engineer onboarding into an existing system (acceptance signal)\n\n**Opening scene:** Riley joins an existing team mid-project.\n**Rising action:** Riley reads the baseline code and its contract tests rather than relying on oral history.\n**Climax:** A constrained operation makes the rules explicit, and the correct pattern is discoverable in code.\n**Resolution:** Onboarding requires fewer explanations, which acts as an acceptance signal that the baseline is doing its job.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- A single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context.\n- Explicit tenant attribution required before operations proceed.\n- Controlled, auditable elevation paths for privileged actions.\n- A clear, inspectable trust contract with runnable verification tests.\n- An extension model that preserves invariants and keeps the core small.\n- Baseline conventions are discoverable in code, not tribal knowledge.\n\n## Developer Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTenantSaas is a developer-facing foundation package for .NET-first multi-tenant systems, with a secondary npm distribution. It is embedded into existing systems as a baseline, not a standalone product.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- The core package must be minimal, invariant-driven, and safe by default.\n- A single, unavoidable integration point anchors tenant context for request paths and background execution.\n- Verification artifacts (contract tests) are part of the core deliverable and runnable by adopters.\n\n### Language Support (Language Matrix)\n\n- **MVP support:** .NET\n- **Secondary distribution:** npm package (for complementary tooling or examples)\n- **Out of scope for MVP:** other runtimes/languages\n\n### Installation Methods\n\n- **NuGet** as the primary installation path.\n- **npm** for any supporting tooling or integration snippets.\n- No IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n\n### API Surface\n\n- Small, stable API surface focused on tenant context, invariants, and verification hooks.\n- Avoid extension points that bypass invariants or widen core behavior.\n- Explicit refusal paths for ambiguous attribution or privileged actions.\n\n### Documentation & Guides (Required for MVP)\n\n- Concise conceptual model.\n- Explicit trust contract.\n- Minimal integration guide.\n- Runnable verification/contract tests guide.\n- Small API reference (focused on the core surface only).\n\n### Code Examples\n\n- One minimal sample project.\n- Copy-paste integration snippets.\n- No full reference application for MVP.\n\n### Migration Guide\n\n- MVP: no migration guide required (greenfield-first baseline).\n- Future: add a migration guide if adopting into existing systems becomes a primary use case.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Baseline must be hard to remove once integrated, without adding operational friction.\n- Contract tests should be easily wired into CI with minimal configuration.\n- Keep documentation crisp and enforce the mental model over feature descriptions.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Problem-solving MVP (prove guarantees are real and usable), with platform discipline for extensibility.\n**Resource Requirements:** 1 person with strong backend/systems thinking, multi-tenant architecture expertise, API/contract design, test rigor, and clear technical writing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Platform engineer integrating into a new service\n- Founder/early builder starting a project\n- Security/compliance reviewer inspecting guarantees\n- Contributor reading/extending the core (design-level)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Explicit baseline model (tenancy, shared system, scope)\n- One unavoidable integration point\n- Enforced invariants (small, non-negotiable)\n- Verification mechanism (contract tests or equivalent)\n- Clear non-goals and refusal behavior\n- Minimal sample + integration snippets\n- Conceptual + contract documentation\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- On-call incident workflows (documented, not deeply supported)\n- New-hire onboarding narratives\n- Advanced ops/support tooling\n- Additional adapters or helpers\n- Observability hooks\n- More ergonomic APIs\n- Extended examples (jobs, reporting, admin)\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Reference app\n- Ecosystem packages and optional extensions\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Guarantees too weak to matter or too rigid to use. Mitigate by keeping invariants minimal, validating in at least one real integration, and treating escape hatches as design failures unless explicitly justified.\n**Market Risks:** Misinterpreted as just another library or too abstract. Mitigate by leading with problem framing, stating non-goals clearly, and anchoring messaging on baseline/foundation rather than productivity.\n**Resource Risks:** Over-engineering and drifting into framework territory. Mitigate by freezing scope, requiring a new invariant for any new capability, and deleting ideas rather than deferring them.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Tenant Context & Baseline Model\n\n-

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This will impact assessment completeness.\n+\n+## PRD Analysis\n+\n+### Functional Requirements\n+\n+FR1: Platform engineers can define the canonical tenant identity model used across the system.  \n+FR2: The system can represent tenant scope and shared-system scope as explicit, distinct contexts.  \n+FR3: The system can represent a no tenant state only when explicitly justified by the trust contract.  \n+FR4: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.  \n+FR5: The baseline model can be referenced as a single source of truth by services integrating it.  \n+FR6: The system can refuse operations with ambiguous or missing tenant attribution.  \n+FR7: The system can enforce an explicit invariant set of <=7 invariants defined and enumerated in the trust contract.  \n+FR8: Invariant enforcement applies uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths.  \n+FR9: The system can surface refusal reasons explicitly to developers when invariants are violated.  \n+FR10: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent and cannot proceed silently.  \n+FR11: The system provides a single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context initialization.  \n+FR12: The integration point can propagate tenant context to downstream operations consistently.  \n+FR13: The integration point can reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent.  \n+FR14: Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold.  \n+FR15: The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement.  \n+FR16: Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence.  \n+FR17: Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package.  \n+FR18: Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts.  \n+FR19: The system provides a conceptual model describing tenancy, scope, and shared-system context in <=800 words or <=2 pages.  \n+FR20: The system provides an explicit trust contract that defines invariants and refusal behavior.  \n+FR21: The system provides an integration guide with <=6 required steps and a reference setup time <=30 minutes.  \n+FR22: The system provides a verification guide that explains how to run and interpret contract tests.  \n+FR23: The system provides an API reference that covers 100% of public surface area and lists all public types/entry points.  \n+FR24: The system defines explicit boundaries where extensions may be built without weakening invariants.  \n+FR25: Adapters can integrate through sanctioned boundaries while preserving the trust contract.  \n+FR26: The core surface blocks bypass paths by restricting entry points to sanctioned boundaries, verified by contract tests covering 100% of public entry points.  \n+FR27: New engineers can locate the trust contract and run contract tests within 60 minutes using the docs alone.  \n+FR28: 100% of refusal errors include actionable guidance and a link to the relevant contract rule, verified by contract tests.  \n+\n+Total FRs: 28\n+\n+### Non-Functional Requirements\n+\n+NFR1: The system shall reject 100% of operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution as measured by contract tests covering request, background, and admin paths.  \n+NFR2: Privileged or cross-scope actions shall require explicit scope declaration and justification fields, verified by contract tests for all privileged operations.  \n+NFR3: The system shall produce zero silent fallbacks when required context is missing, verified by negative tests in CI.  \n+NFR4: Security-relevant behavior shall be covered by contract tests with >=90% branch coverage in the enforcement module, measured in CI.  \n+NFR5: Invariant enforcement shall be deterministic across 10 repeated CI runs with identical inputs yielding identical outcomes (0 variance).  \n+NFR6: Failure modes shall return explicit error codes/messages for 100% of invariant violations, verified by contract tests.  \n+NFR7: Invariant check failures shall return within <=100ms at p95 in reference benchmarks.  \n+NFR8: Core guarantees shall pass the same contract tests across local and CI environments with 0 environment-specific skips.  \n+NFR9: All request paths shall pass through the single integration point in the reference project, verified by tracing tests with 100% coverage.  \n+NFR10: Integration shall require no changes to domain/business logic in the reference project (0 files under domain namespaces modified), verified by sample diff.  \n+NFR11: The integration guide shall include a full wiring example and complete successfully in <=30 minutes for a new service, measured in onboarding trials.  \n+NFR12: If the integration point is removed or bypassed, contract tests shall fail in CI with a specific error within a single test run.  \n+NFR13: Baseline overhead shall add <=1ms at p95 per request in a reference benchmark of 10,000 requests.  \n+NFR14: Enforcement checks shall add <=5% latency when tenant count scales from 1 to 10,000, measured by benchmark.  \n+NFR15: The baseline shall start zero background polling loops or timers by default, verified by runtime inspection tests.  \n+NFR16: Contract tests shall pass with tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000 in load simulations.  \n+NFR17: Reference architecture shall demonstrate multi-service and multi-database topology without special casing, verified by documented example and integration test.  \n+NFR18: All invariants shall remain enforced under 10x load compared to baseline, verified by load tests.  \n+NFR19: Accessibility not applicable; TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.  \n+\n+Total NFRs: 19\n+\n+### Additional Requirements\n+\n+- UX documentation is not required for this project.\n+- MVP support: .NET.\n+- Secondary distribution: npm package (for complementary tooling or examples).\n+- Out of scope for MVP: other runtimes/languages.\n+- Primary install via NuGet; npm only for supporting tooling or integration snippets.\n+- No IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n+- One minimal sample project with copy-paste integration snippets; no full reference application for MVP.\n+- No migration guide required for MVP (greenfield-first baseline).\n+\n+### PRD Completeness Assessment\n+\n+PRD is strong on requirements: FRs and NFRs are explicit, scoped, and measurable. The only missing artifact is UX documentation, which the PRD marks as not required; confirm that remains true for this readiness review.\n*** End Patch"}}

breakdown for TenantSaas, decomposing the requirements from the PRD, UX Design if it exists, and Architecture requirements into implementable stories.\n\n## Requirements Inventory\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nFR1: The baseline defines a canonical tenant identity contract (type + validation + normalization) configurable by adopters.  \nFR2: The system represents tenant scope, shared-system scope, and no-tenant context when explicitly permitted by the trust contract.  \nFR2a: Shared-system scope is a distinct scope (not a wildcard) with its own allowed operations and invariants.  \nFR2b: No-tenant context is an explicit state (not a null tenant) and carries a reason/category defined by the trust contract (e.g., Public, Bootstrap, HealthCheck, SystemMaintenance).  \nFR3: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.  \nFR4: Tenant context is available via an explicit API and optionally via an ambient context with deterministic propagation across async boundaries.  \nFR5: Each execution flow has one required context initialization point (request, background job, admin/scripted), meaning the first moment a context object is established.  \nFR5a: Enforcement operates correctly with either explicit context passing or ambient propagation without weakening invariants.  \nFR6: Enforcement occurs at a small set of boundary helpers/middleware/interceptors, not a full framework.  \nFR6a: Invariant evaluation and tenant context initialization are idempotent and side-effect-free by default (no network calls, persistence writes, or background scheduling).  \nFR7: Operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution are refused by default.  \nFR7a: Tenant attribution uses a declared set of allowed sources (e.g., route, header, host, token claims) with an explicit precedence order.  \nFR7b: If multiple allowed sources disagree, attribution is ambiguous and must refuse.  \nFR7c: If a source is not allowed for the given endpoint or execution kind, attribution must refuse.  \nFR8: Invariants are enumerated, named, finite, and defined in the trust contract.  \nFR9: Enforcement applies across defined execution paths; execution kind is captured in context.  \nFR10: Refusal reasons are explicit and developer-facing.  \nFR11: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent; break-glass requires actor identity + reason and is auditable; it is never implicit or default.  \nFR11a: Break-glass emits a standard audit event containing actor, reason, scope, target_tenant_ref (or cross-tenant marker), trace_id, and invariant_code (or audit_code).  \nFR12: Verification artifacts are provided as a test helper package plus a reference test suite, runnable by adopters in CI without specialized tooling.  \nFR13: The trust contract defines invariants, allowed contexts, break-glass semantics, disclosure policy, and standardized refusal mappings (status + invariant_code + guidance link).  \nFR14: Documentation includes a concise conceptual model, an explicit trust contract, an integration guide, a verification guide, and an API reference.  \nFR15: The package provides shared types and conventions intended to serve as the canonical reference for tenancy.  \nFR16: Extension boundaries are explicit and named (e.g., ITenantResolver, ITenantContextAccessor, IInvariantEvaluator, IInvariantViolationMapper, ILogEnricher).  \nFR17: Sanctioned extensions can integrate without weakening invariants.  \nFR18: All refusals include invariant_code + trace_id; request_id is included for request execution.  \nFR19: Tenant disclosure policy is explicit: tenant_ref is always logged using safe states; errors include tenant info only when safe to disclose.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: The system rejects operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution.  \nNFR2: Privileged or cross-scope actions require explicit scope declaration and justification.  \nNFR3: No silent fallbacks when required context is missing.  \nNFR4: Enforcement is deterministic for identical inputs within the same environment.  \nNFR5: Invariant violations return explicit error codes/messages with stable invariant_code values.  \nNFR5a: invariant_code values and Problem Details type identifiers are stable within a major version; breaking changes require a major version bump and documented migration notes.  \nNFR5b: Contract-test helper APIs follow the same major-version stability guarantees.  \nNFR6: Contract tests demonstrate behavior across execution kinds supported by the reference sample; helpers allow adopters to map their own execution kinds to the same assertions.  \nNFR7: Integration is non-invasive to domain/business logic; changes are confined to boundary/configuration code.  \nNFR8: Bypassing initialization results in refusal with explicit diagnostics.  \nNFR9: Baseline overhead is low and benchmarked; published targets include machine specs and methodology.  \nNFR10: Enforcement scales with tenant count; benchmarks are published for reference loads.  \nNFR11: No default background polling loops or timers are started by the baseline.  \nNFR12: Reference load simulations include tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000 (for published benchmarks).  \nNFR13: Accessibility is not applicable (no end-user UI).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- Baseline constraints:\n  - Core is storage-agnostic; EF Core adapter is reference-only.  \n  - Errors use RFC 7807 Problem Details with invariant_code + trace_id.  \n  - Structured logging requires tenant_ref, trace_id, request_id, invariant_code, event_name, severity; tenant_ref follows disclosure policy.  \n  - Refuse-by-default enforcement with explicit break-glass path.  \n  - BYO-auth posture (sample auth is illustrative only).  \n  - Rate limiting is documented, not implemented in core.  \n- Verification strategy (separate from requirements, but required deliverables):\n  - Black-box contract tests cover refusal on missing/ambiguous context and cross-tenant access.  \n  - Break-glass path requires explicit declaration and is auditable.  \n  - Error shape/log enrichment/correlation rules are asserted.  \n  - Adopters can run the contract test helper package in their own CI.  \n- Reference implementation choices (non-binding):\n  - .NET-first sample; packaging and exact target frameworks are implementation decisions.  \n  - Minimal APIs + Swagger in the sample host.  \n  - SQLite for the sample datastore.  \n  - Repo layout and scaffolding commands are implementation plans, not product requirements.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 4 - Adoption & Portability Hardening\nFR2: Epic 0 - Trust Contract v1 Foundations\nFR2a: Epic 0 - Trust

for enumeration resistance and tenant-existence oracle protection.\n**FRs covered:** (extends Epic 0 and Epic 1 semantics)\n\n<!-- End story repeat -->\n\n## Epic 0: Trust Contract v1 Foundations\n\nLock the semantics early by defining context taxonomy (tenant/shared/no-tenant + reasons), execution kinds, disclosure policy, attribution rules (sources, precedence, ambiguity), invariant registry shape, refusal mapping schema, and break-glass audit contract, backed by core types/enums and refusal/audit schemas.\n\n### Story 0.1: Define Context Taxonomy and Execution Kinds\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a concrete context taxonomy and execution kind model,\nSo that every enforcement decision has unambiguous inputs.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the Trust Contract v1 scope  \n**When** I review the core contracts  \n**Then** I can find explicit definitions for tenant scope, shared-system scope, and no-tenant context  \n**And** no-tenant context requires a reason/category from an allowed set\n\n**Given** the context model  \n**When** execution occurs in request, background, admin, or scripted flows  \n**Then** the execution kind is represented explicitly in the context  \n**And** it is available to enforcement, logging, and refusal mapping\n\n### Story 0.2: Define Tenant Attribution Sources, Precedence, and Ambiguity Rules\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want a declared tenant attribution contract,\nSo that tenant resolution is deterministic and disagreements are refused.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** tenant attribution is required  \n**When** I inspect the tenant resolution contract  \n**Then** I see an allowed set of attribution sources  \n**And** I see a clear precedence order across those sources\n\n**Given** two allowed sources disagree on tenant identity  \n**When** tenant attribution is evaluated  \n**Then** the attribution is classified as ambiguous  \n**And** enforcement can refuse with a stable invariant_code\n\n### Story 0.3: Define Invariant Registry and Refusal Mapping Schema\n\nAs a product owner,\nI want invariants and refusals defined as data,\nSo that behavior is stable, testable, and versionable.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** Trust Contract v1 invariants  \n**When** I review the invariant registry shape  \n**Then** each invariant has a stable identifier and name  \n**And** invariants can be referenced by enforcement, tests, and documentation\n\n**Given** an invariant violation  \n**When** refusal mapping is applied  \n**Then** there is a defined mapping to status, invariant_code, and guidance link  \n**And** the schema supports stable Problem Details type identifiers\n\n### Story 0.4: Define Break-Glass Contract and Standard Audit Event Schema\n\nAs a security reviewer,\nI want break-glass to be explicit and auditable by contract,\nSo that escalations are safer than normal flows, not looser.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a privileged or cross-tenant operation  \n**When** break-glass is used  \n**Then** the contract requires actor identity, reason, and declared scope  \n**And** the contract forbids implicit or default break-glass activation\n\n**Given** break-glass is exercised  \n**When** the audit event is emitted  \n**Then** it includes actor, reason, scope, target_tenant_ref (or cross-tenant marker), trace_id, and invariant_code (or audit_code)  \n**And** the event schema is stable and documented\n\n### Story 0.5: Define Disclosure Policy and tenant_ref Safe States\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want a precise disclosure policy,\nSo that logs and errors do not become tenant existence oracles.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** tenant disclosure is evaluated  \n**When** I review the disclosure policy contract  \n**Then** I see defined tenant_ref safe states (e.g., unknown, sensitive, cross_tenant, opaque id)  \n**And** the policy specifies when tenant information may appear in errors\n\n**Given** a refusal occurs  \n**When** Problem Details are constructed  \n**Then** tenant information is included only when disclosure is safe  \n**And** the policy is available to refusal mapping and logging enrichment\n\n## Epic 1: Refuse-by-Default Enforcement (with Break-Glass Skeleton)\n\nMake tenant mistakes impossible to ignore via boundary enforcement, explicit Problem Details refusals, structured logging enrichment, and a mandatory break-glass path that emits standard audit events.\n\n### Story 1.1: Enforce ContextInitialized at Boundary Helpers\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want boundary enforcement to refuse when context is not initialized,\nSo that missing tenant context fails immediately and predictably.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** an operation enters a sanctioned enforcement boundary  \n**When** no context has been initialized for the execution flow  \n**Then** the operation is refused by default  \n**And** the refusal references the ContextInitialized invariant\n\n**Given** a refusal due to missing context  \n**When** the error is produced  \n**Then** it uses the standardized refusal mapping schema  \n**And** it includes invariant_code and trace_id\n\n### Story 1.2: Enforce TenantAttributionUnambiguous at Boundaries\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want ambiguous tenant attribution to be refused consistently,\nSo that conflicting signals cannot silently choose a tenant.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** tenant attribution is present but ambiguous per the trust contract  \n**When** enforcement is evaluated  \n**Then** the operation is refused  \n**And** the refusal references TenantAttributionUnambiguous\n\n**Given** an ambiguous attribution refusal  \n**When** refusal details are produced  \n**Then** they do not leak tenant existence information  \n**And** they include actionable guidance via the contract mapping\n\n### Story 1.3: Standardize Problem Details Refusals for Invariant Violations\n\nAs a developer,\nI want invariant violations to return a stable, machine-meaningful refusal shape,\nSo that clients, tests, and logs can rely on consistent semantics.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** any invariant violation occurs at an enforcement boundary  \n**When** a refusal is returned  \n**Then** it is expressed as RFC 7807 Problem Details  \n**And** it uses stable type identifiers and invariant_code values within the major version\n\n**Given** a refusal is constructed  \n**When** correlation data is available  \n**Then** trace_id is always present  \n**And** request_id is included for request execution kinds\n\n### Story 1.4: Enrich Structured Logs with tenant_ref and Invariant Context\n\nAs a security reviewer,\nI want refusals and enforcement decisions to be visible in structured logs,\nSo that tenant safety can be audited without exposing sensitive tenant data.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** enforcement decisions are logged  \n**When** logs are emitted  \n**Then** they include tenant_ref, trace_id, request_id (when applicable), invariant_code, event_name, and severity  \n**And** tenant_ref values follow the disclosure policy safe states\n\n**Given** a refusal occurs  \n**When** logs are inspected  \n**Then** the refusal can be correlated with the returned Problem Details  \n**And** no sensitive tenant identifiers are exposed when disclosure is unsafe\n\n### Story 1.5: Require Explicit Break-Glass with Audit Event Emission\n\nAs an on-call responder,\nI want break-glass to be explicit, constrained, and auditable,\nSo that escalations are safer than normal flows, not looser.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a privileged or cross-tenant operation is attempted  \n**When** break-glass is not explicitly declared with actor, reason, and scope  \n**Then** the operation is refused  \n**And** the refusal references BreakGlassExplicitAndAudited\n\n**Given** break-glass is explicitly declared and allowed  \n**When** the operation proceeds  \n**Then** a standard audit event is emitted per the trust contract  \n**And** the audit event includes actor, reason, scope, target_tenant_ref (or cross-tenant marker), trace_id, and invariant_code (or audit_code)\n\n## Epic 2: Context Initialization & Propagation\n\nMake tenancy establishment obvious and reliable with a required initialization primitive per flow, explicit and ambient context propagation, and deterministic async behavior across request/background/admin/scripted wrappers.\n\n### Story 2.1: Provide a Single Required Initialization Primitive per Flow\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want a clear initialization primitive,\nSo that I know exactly where tenancy is established for each execution flow.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a request, background job, admin task, or scripted flow  \n**When** I integrate the baseline  \n**Then** there is one required initialization primitive for that flow  \n**And** it produces a context object with scope, execution kind, and attribution inputs\n\n**Given** initialization is attempted multiple times in the same flow  \n**When** initialization runs  \n**Then** it behaves idempotently  \n**And** it does not create conflicting context state\n\n### Story 2.2: Support Explicit Context Passing Without Ambient Requirements\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want enforcement to work with explicit context passing,\nSo that I can avoid hidden behavior and framework coupling.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a valid context object  \n**When** it is passed explicitly to enforcement boundaries  \n**Then** invariants are evaluated correctly  \n**And** no ambient context is required for correctness\n\n**Given** explicit context passing is used  \n**When** context is missing or inconsistent  \n**Then** enforcement refuses with standardized Problem Details  \n**And** the refusal includes invariant_code and trace_id\n\n### Story 2.3: Provide Ambient Context Propagation with Deterministic Async Behavior\n\nAs a developer,\nI want ambient context propagation as an option,\nSo that I can reduce plumbing without weakening guarantees.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** ambient propagation is enabled  \n**When** execution crosses async boundaries within the same flow  \n**Then** the tenant context remains available deterministically  \n**And** enforcement outcomes match the explicit passing model\n\n**Given** ambient context is enabled  \n**When** a new execution flow begins  \n**Then** no prior context leaks into the new flow  \n**And** context must be explicitly initialized for the new flow\n\n### Story 2.4: Provide Flow Wrappers for Background, Admin, and Scripted Execution\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want clear wrappers for non-request execution kinds,\nSo that tenancy is established consistently outside HTTP.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a background, admin, or scripted operation  \n**When** I use the provided flow wrapper  \n**Then** the wrapper requires explicit initialization inputs  \n**And** it sets execution kind and scope in the context\n\n**Given** a flow wrapper is bypassed  \n**When** enforcement is evaluated downstream  \n**Then** missing context is refused by default  \n**And** the refusal references the ContextInitialized invariant\n\n### Story 2.5: Capture Execution Kind and Scope in Context for Downstream Use\n\nAs a security reviewer,\nI want execution kind and scope captured in context,\nSo that enforcement, logging, and auditing use consistent semantics.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** any initialized context  \n**When** it is inspected by enforcement, logging, or audit mapping  \n**Then** execution kind and scope are available as first-class fields  \n**And** they align with the trust contract taxonomy\n\n## Epic 3: Contract Tests & Compliance Kit\n\nProvide a black-box compliance kit: adopter-runnable helper package plus reference suite that asserts refusals, attribution rules, break-glass constraints, disclosure policy, and error/log correlation across execution kinds.\n\n### Story 3.1: Ship an Adopter-Runnable Contract Test Helper Package\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want contract test helpers I can run in my own CI,\nSo that compliance is a binary signal rather than a review process.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the contract test helper package  \n**When** I add it to my test suite  \n**Then** I can run black-box assertions without specialized tooling  \n**And** the helpers align with the trust contract invariants and refusal mappings\n\n**Given** helper APIs are used  \n**When** versions change within a major version  \n**Then** helper contracts remain stable  \n**And** breaking changes require a major version bump with migration notes\n\n### Story 3.2: Provide Reference Compliance Tests for Refusal and Attribution Rules\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want reference tests that prove the guardrails work,\nSo that I can see failures when invariants are violated.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** reference compliance tests  \n**When** context is missing, ambiguous, or disallowed  \n**Then** operations are refused by default  \n**And** refusals reference the appropriate invariants\n\n**Given** attribution sources disagree  \n**When** compliance tests run  \n**Then** attribution is treated as ambiguous  \n**And** refusal behavior is consistent with the trust contract\n\n### Story 3.3: Assert Break-Glass Constraints and Audit Event Emission\n\nAs a security stakeholder,\nI want break-glass behavior proven by tests,\nSo that escalations cannot bypass the contract silently.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** break-glass is not explicitly declared  \n**When** privileged or cross-tenant operations are attempted  \n**Then** compliance tests fail with a refusal  \n**And** the refusal references BreakGlassExplicitAndAudited\n\n**Given** break-glass is explicitly declared and allowed  \n**When** the operation proceeds in reference tests  \n**Then** a standard audit event is emitted  \n**And** the audit event includes the contract-required fields\n\n### Story 3.4: Assert Disclosure Policy and Error/Log Correlation Rules\n\nAs an auditor,\nI want disclosure safety and correlation proven by contract tests,\nSo that logs and errors are safe and diagnosable together.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a refusal occurs under sensitive disclosure conditions  \n**When** compliance tests inspect Problem Details and logs  \n**Then** tenant information is withheld or redacted per policy  \n**And** tenant_ref uses safe-state values\n\n**Given** any invariant refusal occurs  \n**When** compliance tests inspect output  \n**Then** invariant_code and trace_id appear in both errors and logs  \n**And** request_id appears for request execution kinds\n\n## Epic 4: Adoption & Portability Hardening (Docs + Extension Seams)\n\nProve the brick stays a brick: named extension seams, boundary-only integration guidance, storage/auth agnosticism, and complete docs (conceptual model, trust contract, integration guide, verification guide, API reference).\n\n### Story 4.1: Define and Document Named Extension Seams\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want explicit extension seams,\nSo that I can integrate with my stack without weakening invariants.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the extension model  \n**When** I review the contracts  \n**Then** I see named seams for tenant resolution, context access, invariant evaluation, refusal mapping, and log enrichment  \n**And** each seam states what is customizable versus invariant-protected\n\n**Given** extensions are implemented  \n**When** compliance tests are run  \n**Then** extensions can pass without bypassing enforcement boundaries\n\n### Story 4.2: Provide a Boundary-Only Integration Guide\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want an integration guide that avoids domain rewrites,\nSo that adoption cost stays low.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the integration guide  \n**When** I follow it end to end  \n**Then** integration steps are focused on boundaries and configuration  \n**And** the guide makes no requirement to rewrite domain logic\n\n**Given** integration is complete  \n**When** I run compliance tests  \n**Then** they exercise the configured boundaries successfully  \n**And** failures point back to specific contract rules\n\n### Story 4.3: Prove Storage-Agnostic Core with Reference-Only Adapters\n\nAs a technical lead,\nI want confidence that the core stays storage-agnostic,\nSo that the baseline remains portable across data layers.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the core packages  \n**When** dependencies are reviewed  \n**Then** storage-specific dependencies are not required by the core  \n**And** reference adapters are isolated as optional components\n\n**Given** the reference adapter is used  \n**When** it integrates with the core  \n**Then** it uses sanctioned seams and boundaries  \n**And** the core invariants remain enforced\n\n### Story 4.4: Publish the Trust Contract, Conceptual Model, Verification Guide, and API Reference\n\nAs an adopter,\nI want complete but focused documentation,\nSo that I can understand, integrate, and verify the baseline quickly.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the documentation set  \n**When** I review it as a new adopter  \n**Then** I can find the conceptual model, trust contract, integration guide, verification guide, and API reference  \n**And** each document links to the others and uses consistent invariant identifiers\n\n**Given** the API reference  \n**When** public surface area changes  \n**Then** the reference updates in the same change  \n**And** contract identifiers remain stable within a major version\n\n## Epic 5: Advanced Escalation & Cross-Scope Scenarios\n\nHarden the dangerous edges with deeper cross-tenant admin flows, explicit shared-system operations, stronger audit options, and additional contract tests for enumeration resistance and tenant-existence oracle protection.\n\n### Story 5.1: Define Explicit Shared-System Operations and Allowed Invariants\n\nAs an architect,\nI want shared-system scope to be explicit and bounded,\nSo that it cannot become a hidden wildcard.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** shared-system scope is used  \n**When** its allowed operations are reviewed  \n**Then** the allowed operations are explicit  \n**And** they are mapped to specific invariants and refusal rules\n\n**Given** a shared-system operation violates scope rules  \n**When** enforcement is evaluated  \n**Then** the operation is refused  \n**And** the refusal is standardized and auditable\n\n### Story 5.2: Support Safe Cross-Tenant Administrative Workflows\n\nAs an on-call responder,\nI want cross-tenant workflows to be explicit and constrained,\nSo that urgent fixes do not weaken tenant isolation guarantees.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a cross-tenant administrative operation is required  \n**When** it is executed without explicit break-glass and scope declaration  \n**Then** enforcement refuses the operation  \n**And** the refusal references the appropriate invariants\n\n**Given** a cross-tenant operation is explicitly authorized  \n**When** it proceeds  \n**Then** audit events capture cross-tenant markers and scope details  \n**And** disclosure policy is enforced for errors and logs\n\n### Story 5.3: Provide an Optional Audit Sink Interface with Strong Defaults\n\nAs a compliance stakeholder,\nI want a clear audit integration point,\nSo that audit durability can be improved without coupling the core.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the audit model  \n**When** I review extension seams  \n**Then** there is an optional audit sink interface  \n**And** the default behavior still emits contract-compliant structured events\n\n**Given** a custom audit sink is provided  \n**When** audit events are emitted  \n**Then** required audit fields are preserved  \n**And** compliance tests can assert the audit contract is still satisfied\n\n### Story 5.4: Add Compliance Tests for Enumeration Resistance and Tenant-Existence Oracle Protection\n\nAs a security reviewer,\nI want the subtle leak cases covered,\nSo that “safe by default” holds under adversarial usage.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** sensitive disclosure conditions  \n**When** compliance tests run against refusal behaviors  \n**Then** tenant existence cannot be inferred from error differences  \n**And** disclosure policy is consistently applied\n\n**Given** attribution and scope rules are stressed across execution kinds  \n**When** compliance tests run  \n**Then** refusals remain standardized and correlated  \n**And** invariant identifiers remain stable and machine-meaningful\n"}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Initialize UX Validation\n\n\"Beginning **UX Alignment** validation.\n\nI will:\n\n1. Check if UX documentation exists\n2. If UX exists: validate alignment with PRD and Architecture\n3. If no UX: determine if UX is implied and document warning\"\n\n### 2. Search for UX Documentation\n\nSearch patterns:\n\n- `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md` (whole document)\n- `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/index.md` (sharded)\n- Look for UI-related terms in other documents\n\n### 3. If UX Document Exists\n\n#### A. UX ↔ PRD Alignment\n\n- Check UX requirements reflected in PRD\n- Verify user journeys in UX match PRD use cases\n- Identify UX requirements not in PRD\n\n#### B. UX ↔ Architecture Alignment\n\n- Verify architecture supports UX requirements\n- Check performance needs (responsiveness, load times)\n- Identify UI components not supported by architecture\n\n### 4. If No UX Document\n\nAssess if UX/UI is implied:\n\n- Does PRD mention user interface?\n- Are there web/mobile components implied?\n- Is this a user-facing application?\n\nIf UX implied but missing: Add warning to report\n\n### 5. Add Findings to Report\n\nAppend to {outputFile}:\n\n```markdown\n## UX Alignment Assessment\n\n### UX Document Status\n\n[Found/Not Found]\n\n### Alignment Issues\n\n[List any misalignments between UX, PRD, and Architecture]\n\n### Warnings\n\n[Any warnings about missing UX or architectural gaps]\n```\n\n### 6. Auto-Proceed to Next Step\n\nAfter UX assessment complete, immediately load next step.\n\n## PROCEEDING TO EPIC QUALITY REVIEW\n\nUX alignment assessment complete. Loading next step for epic quality review.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- UX document existence checked\n- Alignment validated if UX exists\n- Warning issued if UX implied but missing\n- Findings added to report\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not checking for UX document\n- Ignoring alignment issues\n- Not documenting warnings\n"}}

Initialize Best Practices Validation\n\n\"Beginning **Epic Quality Review** against create-epics-and-stories standards.\n\nI will rigorously validate:\n\n- Epics deliver user value (not technical milestones)\n- Epic independence (Epic 2 doesn't need Epic 3)\n- Story dependencies (no forward references)\n- Proper story sizing and completeness\n\nAny deviation from best practices will be flagged as a defect.\"\n\n### 2. Epic Structure Validation\n\n#### A. User Value Focus Check\n\nFor each epic:\n\n- **Epic Title:** Is it user-centric (what user can do)?\n- **Epic Goal:** Does it describe user outcome?\n- **Value Proposition:** Can users benefit from this epic alone?\n\n**Red flags (violations):**\n\n- \"Setup Database\" or \"Create Models\" - no user value\n- \"API Development\" - technical milestone\n- \"Infrastructure Setup\" - not user-facing\n- \"Authentication System\" - borderline (is it user value?)\n\n#### B. Epic Independence Validation\n\nTest epic independence:\n\n- **Epic 1:** Must stand alone completely\n- **Epic 2:** Can function using only Epic 1 output\n- **Epic 3:** Can function using Epic 1 & 2 outputs\n- **Rule:** Epic N cannot require Epic N+1 to work\n\n**Document failures:**\n\n- \"Epic 2 requires Epic 3 features to function\"\n- Stories in Epic 2 referencing Epic 3 components\n- Circular dependencies between epics\n\n### 3. Story Quality Assessment\n\n#### A. Story Sizing Validation\n\nCheck each story:\n\n- **Clear User Value:** Does the story deliver something meaningful?\n- **Independent:** Can it be completed without future stories?\n\n**Common violations:**\n\n- \"Setup all models\" - not a USER story\n- \"Create login UI (depends on Story 1.3)\" - forward dependency\n\n#### B. Acceptance Criteria Review\n\nFor each story's ACs:\n\n- **Given/When/Then Format:** Proper BDD structure?\n- **Testable:** Each AC can be verified independently?\n- **Complete:** Covers all scenarios including errors?\n- **Specific:** Clear expected outcomes?\n\n**Issues to find:**\n\n- Vague criteria like \"user can login\"\n- Missing error conditions\n- Incomplete happy path\n- Non-measurable outcomes\n\n### 4. Dependency Analysis\n\n#### A. Within-Epic Dependencies\n\nMap story dependencies within each epic:\n\n- Story 1.1 must be completable alone\n- Story 1.2 can use Story 1.1 output\n- Story 1.3 can use Story 1.1 & 1.2 outputs\n\n**Critical violations:**\n\n- \"This story depends on Story 1.4\"\n- \"Wait for future story to work\"\n- Stories referencing features not yet implemented\n\n#### B. Database/Entity Creation Timing\n\nValidate database creation approach:\n\n- **Wrong:** Epic 1 Story 1 creates all tables upfront\n- **Right:** Each story creates tables it needs\n- **Check:** Are tables created only when first needed?\n\n### 5. Special Implementation Checks\n\n#### A. Starter Template Requirement\n\nCheck if Architecture specifies starter template:\n\n- If YES: Epic 1 Story 1 must be \"Set up initial project from starter template\"\n- Verify story includes cloning, dependencies, initial configuration\n\n#### B. Greenfield vs Brownfield Indicators\n\nGreenfield projects should have:\n\n- Initial project setup story\n- Development environment configuration\n- CI/CD pipeline setup early\n\nBrownfield projects should have:\n\n- Integration points with existing systems\n- Migration or compatibility stories\n\n### 6. Best Practices Compliance Checklist\n\nFor each epic, verify:\n\n- [ ] Epic delivers user value\n- [ ] Epic can function independently\n- [ ] Stories appropriately sized\n- [ ] No forward dependencies\n- [ ] Database tables created when needed\n- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Traceability to FRs maintained\n\n### 7. Quality Assessment Documentation\n\nDocument all findings by severity:\n\n#### 🔴 Critical Violations\n\n- Technical epics with no user value\n- Forward dependencies breaking independence\n- Epic-sized stories that cannot be completed\n\n#### 🟠 Major Issues\n\n- Vague acceptance criteria\n- Stories requiring future stories\n- Database creation violations\n\n#### 🟡 Minor Concerns\n\n- Formatting inconsistencies\n- Minor structure deviations\n- Documentation gaps\n\n### 8. Autonomous Review Execution\n\nThis review runs autonomously to maintain standards:\n\n- Apply best practices without compromise\n- Document every violation with specific examples\n- Provide clear remediation guidance\n- Prepare recommendations for each issue\n\n## REVIEW COMPLETION:\n\nAfter completing epic quality review:\n\n- Update {outputFile} with all quality findings\n- Document specific best practices violations\n- Provide actionable recommendations\n- Load {nextStepFile} for final readiness assessment\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nThis step executes autonomously. Load {nextStepFile} only after complete epic quality review is documented.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All epics validated against best practices\n- Every dependency checked and verified\n- Quality violations documented with examples\n- Clear remediation guidance provided\n- No compromise on standards enforcement\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Accepting technical epics as valid\n- Ignoring forward dependencies\n- Not verifying story sizing\n- Overlooking obvious violations\n\n**Master Rule:** Enforce best practices rigorously. Find all violations.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

UX is not implied for this product scope.\n+\n+## Epic Quality Review\n+\n+### 🔴 Critical Violations\n+\n+- **Technical epics with no explicit user value.** Epics 0–5 are framed as technical milestones (contract definition, enforcement, context propagation, tests, docs). For a PM-quality epic structure, each epic should state a user outcome, not a technical construction activity.\n+- **Epic independence violated (forward dependency chain).**  \n+  - Epic 1 (Enforcement) depends on Epic 0 (Trust Contract definitions).  \n+  - Epic 2 (Context Initialization) depends on Epic 0 (taxonomy, execution kinds).  \n+  - Epic 3 (Contract Tests) depends on Epic 0/1/2 (invariants, enforcement behaviors).  \n+  - Epic 4 (Docs + Extension Seams) depends on Epic 0–3 outputs.  \n+  This is a strict N→N+1 dependency chain, disallowed by best practices.\n+\n+### 🟠 Major Issues\n+\n+- **Missing starter-template setup story.** Architecture explicitly mandates a .NET SDK starter template; no story covers initializing from that template and wiring baseline scaffolding.\n+- **Greenfield setup gaps.** No explicit stories for dev environment setup and CI/CD pipeline bootstrap, despite greenfield context.\n+- **Story independence risk.** Several stories in Epic 0/1/2 are specification-heavy (contracts, schemas, policies) without a concrete “done” artifact and acceptance outcomes that deliver user-visible value on their own.\n+\n+### 🟡 Minor Concerns\n+\n+- Some stories emphasize policy/contract definitions but do not consistently include failure-mode examples or test vectors in ACs; adding these improves testability.\n+\n+### Recommendations\n+\n+- Reframe epics around user outcomes (platform engineer can adopt baseline, security reviewer can verify guarantees, etc.) and move technical construction tasks into stories.  \n+- Restructure into independent epics that can ship value sequentially without requiring future epics (e.g., “Adopt baseline in one service” as Epic 1, “Prove enforcement in CI” as Epic 2).  \n+- Add explicit greenfield setup stories: starter template initialization, local dev workflow, and CI contract-test pipeline.  \n+- Convert contract-definition stories into tangible deliverables (e.g., “Publish Trust Contract v1 doc + schema + example enforcement mapping”).\n*** End Patch"}}

If the completing the task requires escalated permissions, Do not let these settings or the sandbox deter you from attempting to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere are scenarios where you'll need to request approval:\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- You are running sandboxed and need to run a command that requires network access (e.g. installing packages)\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with approval. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nWhen requesting approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n  - Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n  - Include a short, 1 sentence explanation for why you need escalated permissions in the justification parameter The writable roots are `/home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas`, `/tmp`.</permissions instructions>"}]}}

This workflow requires completed PRD + Architecture documents (UX recommended if UI exists) and breaks down requirements into implementation-ready epics and user stories that incorporate all available technical and design context. Creates detailed, actionable stories with complete acceptance criteria for development teams.'\nweb_bundle: true\n---\n\n# Create Epics and Stories\n\n**Goal:** Transform PRD requirements and Architecture decisions into comprehensive stories organized by user value, creating detailed, actionable stories with complete acceptance criteria for development teams.\n\n**Your Role:** In addition to your name, communication_style, and persona, you are also a product strategist and technical specifications writer collaborating with a product owner. This is a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship. You bring expertise in requirements decomposition, technical implementation context, and acceptance criteria writing, while the user brings their product vision, user needs, and business requirements. Work together as equals.\n\n---\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\nThis uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step of the overall goal is a self contained instruction file that you will adhere too 1 file as directed at a time\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only 1 current step file will be loaded, read, and executed to completion - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`\n- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nLoad, read the full file and then execute `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-epics-and-stories/steps/step-01-validate-prerequisites.md` to begin the workflow.\n"}}

Welcome and Overview\n\nWelcome {user_name} to comprehensive epic and story creation!\n\n**CRITICAL PREREQUISITE VALIDATION:**\n\nVerify required documents exist and are complete:\n\n1. **PRD.md** - Contains requirements (FRs and NFRs) and product scope\n2. **Architecture.md** - Contains technical decisions, API contracts, data models\n3. **UX Design.md** (if UI exists) - Contains interaction patterns, mockups, user flows\n\n### 2. Document Discovery and Validation\n\nSearch for required documents using these patterns (sharded means a large document was split into multiple small files with an index.md into a folder) - if the whole document is found, use that instead of the sharded version:\n\n**PRD Document Search Priority:**\n\n1. `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md` (whole document)\n2. `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/index.md` (sharded version)\n\n**Architecture Document Search Priority:**\n\n1. `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md` (whole document)\n2. `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/index.md` (sharded version)\n\n**UX Design Document Search (Optional):**\n\n1. `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md` (whole document)\n2. `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/index.md` (sharded version)\n\nBefore proceeding, Ask the user if there are any other documents to include for analysis, and if anything found should be excluded. Wait for user confirmation. Once confirmed, create the {outputFile} from the {epicsTemplate} and in the front matter list the files in the array of `inputDocuments: []`.\n\n### 3. Extract Functional Requirements (FRs)\n\nFrom the PRD document (full or sharded), read then entire document and extract ALL functional requirements:\n\n**Extraction Method:**\n\n- Look for numbered items like \"FR1:\", \"Functional Requirement 1:\", or similar\n- Identify requirement statements that describe what the system must DO\n- Include user actions, system behaviors, and business rules\n\n**Format the FR list as:**\n\n```\nFR1: [Clear, testable requirement description]\nFR2: [Clear, testable requirement description]\n...\n```\n\n### 4. Extract Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n\nFrom the PRD document, extract ALL non-functional requirements:\n\n**Extraction Method:**\n\n- Look for performance, security, usability, reliability requirements\n- Identify constraints and quality attributes\n- Include technical standards and compliance requirements\n\n**Format the NFR list as:**\n\n```\nNFR1: [Performance/Security/Usability requirement]\nNFR2: [Performance/Security/Usability requirement]\n...\n```\n\n### 5. Extract Additional Requirements from Architecture\n\nReview the Architecture document for technical requirements that impact epic and story creation:\n\n**Look for:**\n\n- **Starter Template**: Does Architecture specify a starter/greenfield template? If YES, document this for Epic 1 Story 1\n- Infrastructure and deployment requirements\n- Integration requirements with external systems\n- Data migration or setup requirements\n- Monitoring and logging requirements\n- API versioning or compatibility requirements\n- Security implementation requirements\n\n**IMPORTANT**: If a starter template is mentioned in Architecture, note it prominently. This will impact Epic 1 Story 1.\n\n**Format Additional Requirements as:**\n\n```\n- [Technical requirement from Architecture that affects implementation]\n- [Infrastructure setup requirement]\n- [Integration requirement]\n...\n```\n\n### 6. Extract Additional Requirements from UX (if exists)\n\nReview the UX document for requirements that affect epic and story creation:\n\n**Look for:**\n\n- Responsive design requirements\n- Accessibility requirements\n- Browser/device compatibility\n- User interaction patterns that need implementation\n- Animation or transition requirements\n- Error handling UX requirements\n\n**Add these to Additional Requirements list.**\n\n### 7. Load and Initialize Template\n\nLoad {epicsTemplate} and initialize {outputFile}:\n\n1. Copy the entire template to {outputFile}\n2. Replace {{project_name}} with the actual project name\n3. Replace placeholder sections with extracted requirements:\n   - {{fr_list}} → extracted FRs\n   - {{nfr_list}} → extracted NFRs\n   - {{additional_requirements}} → extracted additional requirements\n4. Leave {{requirements_coverage_map}} and {{epics_list}} as placeholders for now\n\n### 8. Present Extracted Requirements\n\nDisplay to user:\n\n**Functional Requirements Extracted:**\n\n- Show count of FRs found\n- Display the first few FRs as examples\n- Ask if any FRs are missing or incorrectly captured\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements Extracted:**\n\n- Show count of NFRs found\n- Display key NFRs\n- Ask if any constraints were missed\n\n**Additional Requirements:**\n\n- Summarize technical requirements from Architecture\n- Summarize UX requirements (if applicable)\n- Verify completeness\n\n### 9. Get User Confirmation\n\nAsk: \"Do these extracted requirements accurately represent what needs to be built? Any additions or corrections?\"\n\nUpdate the requirements based on user feedback until confirmation is received.\n\n## CONTENT TO SAVE TO DOCUMENT:\n\nAfter extraction and confirmation, update {outputFile} with:\n\n- Complete FR list in {{fr_list}} section\n- Complete NFR list in {{nfr_list}} section\n- All additional requirements in {{additional_requirements}} section\n\n### 10. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: `**Confirm the Requirements are complete and correct to [C] continue:**`\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then end with display again of the menu option\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Save all to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#10-present-menu-options)\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN C is selected and all requirements are saved to document and frontmatter is updated, will you then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile} to execute and begin epic design step.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All required documents found and validated\n- All FRs extracted and formatted correctly\n- All NFRs extracted and formatted correctly\n- Additional requirements from Architecture/UX identified\n- Template initialized with requirements\n- User confirms requirements are complete and accurate\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Missing required documents\n- Incomplete requirements extraction\n- Template not properly initialized\n- Not saving requirements to output file\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
