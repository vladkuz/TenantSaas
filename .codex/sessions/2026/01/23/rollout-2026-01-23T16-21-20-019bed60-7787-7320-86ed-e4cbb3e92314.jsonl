You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Mode Determination\n\n**Check if mode was specified in the command invocation:**\n\n- If user invoked with \"create prd\" or \"new prd\" or \"build prd\" or \"-c\" or \"--create\" → Set mode to **create**\n- If user invoked with \"validate prd\" or \"review prd\" or \"check prd\" or \"-v\" or \"--validate\" → Set mode to **validate**\n- If user invoked with \"edit prd\" or \"modify prd\" or \"improve prd\" or \"-e\" or \"--edit\" → Set mode to **edit**\n\n**If mode is still unclear, ask user:**\n\n\"**PRD Workflow - Select Mode:**\n\n**[C] Create** - Create a new PRD from scratch\n**[V] Validate** - Validate an existing PRD against BMAD standards\n**[E] Edit** - Improve an existing PRD\n\nWhich mode would you like?\"\n\nWait for user selection.\n\n### 2. Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {main_config} and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`\n- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`\n- `date` as system-generated current datetime\n\n✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the configured `{communication_language}`.\n\n### 3. Route to Appropriate Workflow\n\n**IF mode == create:**\n\"**Create Mode: Creating a new PRD from scratch.**\"\nLoad, read entire file, then execute `{nextStep}` (steps-c/step-01-init.md)\n\n**IF mode == validate:**\n\"**Validate Mode: Validating an existing PRD against BMAD standards.**\"\nPrompt for PRD path: \"Which PRD would you like to validate?

Check for Existing Workflow State\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n**Workflow State Detection:**\n\n- Look for file at `{outputFile}`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted` BUT `step-11-complete` is NOT in the list, follow the Continuation Protocol since the document is incomplete:\n\n**Continuation Protocol:**\n\n- **STOP immediately** and load `{continueStepFile}`\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle all continuation logic\n- This is an auto-proceed situation - no user choice needed\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery. Documents can be in the following locations:\n- {planning_artifacts}/**\n- {output_folder}/**\n- {product_knowledge}/**\n- docs/**\n\nAlso - when searching - documents can be a single markdown file, or a folder with an index and multiple files. For Example, if searching for `*foo*.md` and not found, also search for a folder called *foo*/index.md (which indicates sharded content)\n\nTry to discover the following:\n- Product Brief (`*brief*.md`)\n- Research Documents (`/*research*.md`)\n- Project Documentation (generally multiple documents might be found for this in the `{product_knowledge}` or `docs` folder.)\n- Project Context (`**/project-context.md`)\n\n<critical>Confirm what you have found with the user, along with asking if the user wants to provide anything else. Only after this confirmation will you proceed to follow the loading rules</critical>\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely that the user confirmed or provided (no offset/limit)\n- If there is a project context, whatever is relevant should try to be biased in the remainder of this whole workflow process\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture, using the index first to potentially know the potential of each document\n- index.md is a guide to what's relevant whenever available\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Create Initial Document\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Copy the template from `{prdTemplate}` to `{outputFile}`\n- Initialize frontmatter with proper structure including inputDocuments array.\n\n#### C. Present Initialization Results\n\n**Setup Report to User:**\n\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your PRD workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{outputFile}` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\n\n- Product briefs: {{briefCount}} files {if briefCount > 0}✓ loaded{else}(none found){/if}\n- Research: {{researchCount}} files {if researchCount > 0}✓ loaded{else}(none found){/if}\n- Brainstorming: {{brainstormingCount}} files {if brainstormingCount > 0}✓ loaded{else}(none found){/if}\n- Project docs: {{projectDocsCount}} files {if projectDocsCount > 0}✓ loaded (brownfield project){else}(none found - greenfield project){/if}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\n{if projectDocsCount > 0}\n📋 **Note:** This is a **brownfield project**. Your existing project documentation has been loaded. In the next step, I'll ask specifically about what new features or changes you want to add to your existing system.\n{/if}\n\nDo you have any other documents you'd like me to include, or shall we continue to the next step?\"\n\n### 4. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay menu after setup report:\n\n\"[C] Continue - Save this and move to Project Discovery (Step 2 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Update output file frontmatter, adding this step name to the end of the list of stepsCompleted, then load, read entire {nextStepFile}, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF user provides additional files: Load them, update inputDocuments and documentCounts, redisplay report\n- IF user asks questions: Answer and redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [frontmatter properly updated with this step added to stepsCompleted and documentCounts], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin project discovery.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Existing workflow detected and properly handed off to step-01b\n- Fresh workflow initialized with template and proper frontmatter\n- Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n- All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n- User clearly informed of brownfield vs greenfield status\n- Menu presented and user input handled correctly\n- Frontmatter updated with this step name added to stepsCompleted before proceeding\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n- Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n- **Not storing document counts in frontmatter**\n- Creating document without proper template structure\n- Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n- Not reporting discovered documents to user clearly\n- Proceeding without user selecting 'C' (Continue)\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It addresses a systemic safety problem: teams routinely perform shared-system actions with ambiguous ownership, scope, or authority, which leads to irreversible trust failures. The product encodes trust as explicit invariants, enforced at unavoidable choke points, so unsafe actions fail immediately and clearly. The goal is to make it hard to build multi-tenant systems incorrectly-and impossible to do so quietly.\n\n---\n\n## Core Vision\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nMulti-tenant SaaS systems regularly allow actions whose tenant ownership, scope, or authority is implicit or ambiguous. This ambiguity produces latent, catastrophic failures-cross-tenant exposure, corrupted state, and unverifiable incident response-because enforcement depends on human discipline rather than mechanical guarantees.\n\n### Problem Impact\n\nWhen the first cross-tenant violation occurs, trust is permanently damaged. Teams face legal and compliance exposure, velocity drops under fear, and systems accrete defensive complexity instead of clarity. On-call engineers, senior platform owners, founders, and security reviewers bear the earliest and most intense consequences because they are closest to the blast radius.\n\n### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short\n\nMost frameworks and libraries optimize for multi-tenancy capabilities, not guarantees. Enforcement is partial and contextual (HTTP middleware but not jobs), tenant attribution is often optional or implicit, privilege is treated as a role rather than a scoped event, and proof is absent. This creates safety gaps exactly where incidents occur and produces false confidence that persists until failure.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nA trust-first foundation that requires explicit attribution, refuses ambiguous actions, enforces invariants at a small set of unavoidable choke points, and makes exceptional power explicit and reviewable. The system shifts multi-tenant safety from \"best practices\" to \"mechanically enforced guarantees.\"\n\n### Key Differentiators\n\n- Guarantees over capabilities: define what must never happen, then enforce it.\n- Invariant-first design with unavoidable enforcement boundaries.\n- Formal scope and privilege semantics; exceptional power is explicit and auditable.\n- Executable proof of correctness (e.g., contract tests), not narrative assurance.\n- Deliberately narrow surface area to preserve trust under stress.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n\n**Senior / Platform Engineers**  \nThey own system integrity over time and are accountable for failures caused by entropy, team growth, and inconsistent enforcement. They need mechanical guarantees, a shared mental model that scales across teams, and fewer ad-hoc exceptions to police. TenantSaas becomes a trust kernel and policy anchor they can standardize across services.\n\n**Founders & Early SaaS Builders**  \nThey move fast and cannot afford one existential trust failure. They need protection without cognitive overhead, early guardrails that don’t slow iteration, and confidence they didn’t miss something fundamental. TenantSaas lets them ship while eliminating silent risk.\n\n### Secondary Users\n\n**On-Call / Incident Responders**  \nThey act under pressure with elevated privileges. They need clear blast-radius boundaries, safe inspection/repair paths, and guardrails that prevent accidental escalation.\n\n**Security, Compliance, and Audit Stakeholders**  \nThey must validate guarantees that usually exist only as intent. They need inspectable controls, repeatable evidence, and clear answers to “how is this enforced?”\n\n**New Engineers / Maintainers**  \nThey inherit implicit rules. They need a system that teaches correct behavior through constraints and provides fast feedback when actions are unsafe.\n\n### User Journey\n\n**Founders / Early SaaS Builders**  \nDiscovery arises during multi-tenant design, near-misses, or enterprise readiness. Onboarding is fast and opinionated: explicit attribution is required, unsafe defaults fail loudly. Day-to-day, it runs mostly invisibly, with occasional explicit scoping or privilege justification. Success is often negative-a dangerous mistake is prevented. Long-term, it becomes baseline infrastructure and fades into the background.\n\n**Senior / Platform Engineers**  \nDiscovery follows incidents, inconsistent tenant handling, or org-wide standardization needs. Onboarding is deliberate: they inspect the trust contract, enforcement points, and contract tests, then adopt in high-risk areas first. Day-to-day, it serves as a policy anchor that constrains patterns and standardizes privilege handling. Success is governance that emerges without meetings-safe integration, contained incidents, and evidence-based audits. Long-term, it becomes part of platform standards and shapes new services by default.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nUser success is felt when TenantSaas fades into the background while making progress more reliable. Teams can model tenants, roles, and shared infrastructure without inventing new mental frameworks; early architectural decisions hold; growth is incremental rather than destabilizing; and the system remains understandable months later. The “worth it” moment is when teams realize they didn’t have to rethink multi-tenancy, rewrite core assumptions, or teach tribal rules to new engineers.\n\n### Business Objectives\n\n**~3 months (validation):**  \nValidate resonance with serious builders (platform engineers, committed founders), prove TenantSaas is understood as a baseline/substrate, build credibility through depth and restraint, and confirm adoption without immediate forking. Success = “the right people are paying attention and taking it seriously.”\n\n**~12 months (traction & positioning):**  \nEstablish TenantSaas as a reference baseline for multi-tenant SaaS architecture, keep it in place as systems grow, anchor governance and structure discussions, and pull follow-on extensions organically. Success = “this shaped how teams think about multi-tenant SaaS, not just how they scaffold it.”\n\n### Key Performance Indicators\n\n**Leading indicators (early, high-signal):**\n- Projects integrating TenantSaas into non-toy codebases\n- Retention after initial experimentation\n- Frequency of users extending it rather than bypassing it\n- Quality of inbound feedback (long-form issues, design discussions, PRs)\n- References in blog posts, talks, or internal docs\n\n**Adoption & engagement:**\n- Active projects using TenantSaas over time\n- Repeat usage across multiple projects by the same team/org\n- Time from discovery to first meaningful integration\n- Usage in CI or baseline tests\n\n**Ecosystem & pull-through:**\n- Requests for examples/patterns/extensions (not feature breadth)\n- Community contributions that respect the core contract\n- External tools or docs referencing TenantSaas concepts\n- Mentions in discussions about SaaS architecture vs tooling\n\n**Not optimized for:**\n- Raw downloads or stars\n- One-click onboarding metrics\n- Feature requests that dilute the core\n- Broad appeal to all .NET developers\n\n## MVP Scope\n\n### Core Features\n\nThe MVP is the smallest baseline that prevents early architectural regret. It delivers:\n\n- A clear, explicit model for multi-tenant SaaS (tenant, shared infra, scope/context)\n- A small set of enforced invariants (no ambiguous attribution; explicit exceptional behavior)\n- A single unavoidable integration point that anchors the baseline early\n- A proof mechanism (executable tests/assertions/verification hooks)\n\nThe MVP includes a minimal but opinionated core, a precise trust/baseline contract, and documentation that explains the model (not feature breadth).\n\n### Out of Scope for MVP\n\nExplicitly out of scope:\n\n- Billing, subscriptions, pricing, metering\n- Authentication / identity providers\n- Authorization frameworks or RBAC systems\n- UI scaffolding or admin dashboards\n- Feature flags or plan-based behavior\n- Multi-region or data residency support\n- Database sharding or DB-per-tenant orchestration\n- Tenant lifecycle workflows (provisioning/activation)\n- Background job frameworks\n- Observability platforms (metrics, dashboards, tracing)\n- Enterprise compliance tooling (SOC2 automation, GDPR exports)\n- Opinionated frontend stacks\n- Turn-key SaaS templates\n\nAnything that expands surface area, introduces product-specific policy, or can only be validated at scale is deferred.\n\n### MVP Success Criteria\n\n**Adoption & usage:**\n- Integrated into non-toy projects\n- Adopted early in the lifecycle\n- Retained after initial experimentation\n- Core model/API remains stable across projects\n\n**Behavioral signals:**\n- Teams stop inventing bespoke baselines\n- Architectural debates about multi-tenancy shrink or disappear\n- New engineers onboard without long verbal downloads\n- Users extend around the baseline rather than bypass it\n\n**Proof & credibility:**\n- Concrete baseline artifacts exist and are referenced\n- Verification hooks/contract tests are actually run\n- Ambiguous actions are blocked or clarified early\n- External reviewers quickly understand the role\n\n**Negative signals that still indicate success:**\n- Few requests for “everything else”\n- Some users opt out because it’s opinionated\n- Minimal churn due to missing conveniences\n\nIf removing it would feel risky, the MVP succeeded.\n\n### Future Vision\n\nTenantSaas becomes a de facto baseline and trust kernel for serious multi-tenant SaaS systems. The core stays small and conservative while an ecosystem of extensions, examples, integrations, and policy layers grows around it. It becomes the reference point for tenant modeling, scope handling, and shared-system governance-shaping how teams think about SaaS architecture, not just what they scaffold.\n"}}

Brainstorming Session Results\n\n**Facilitator:** {{user_name}}\n**Date:** {{date}}\n\n## Session Overview\n\n**Topic:** Define what the project should scaffold and how it can be meaningfully better for users.\n**Goals:** Build clearer understanding of the product and its value to users.\n\n### Context Guidance\n\nFocus areas include user problems, feature ideas, technical approaches, UX, business value, differentiation, risks, and success metrics.\n\n### Session Setup\n\nWe will explore scaffolding scope, user impact, and differentiators to sharpen the product definition before drafting downstream planning artifacts.\n\n## Technique Selection\n\n**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques\n**Analysis Context:** Define scaffolding scope and differentiation with focus on clarifying what is being built and sharpening user value.\n\n**Recommended Techniques:**\n\n- **First Principles Thinking:** Strip assumptions about scaffolds to define core truths users need, establishing the baseline scope.\n- **SCAMPER Method:** Systematically vary the scaffold to generate differentiated options and feature angles.\n- **Role Playing:** Pressure-test ideas through stakeholder lenses to prioritize what is genuinely valuable.\n\n**AI Rationale:** Start with fundamentals, expand the idea space methodically, then validate against real-world user perspectives.\n\n## Technique Execution Results\n\n**First Principles Thinking:**\n\n- **Interactive Focus:** Core truths of multi-tenant trust, scope semantics, and enforceable guarantees.\n- **Key Breakthroughs:** Trust contract as the product, scope calculus with explicit transitions, and a capability matrix to prevent privilege creep.\n- **Developed Ideas:** Invariant-first scaffold, deterministic tenant context, frictionful admin elevation, dedicated reporting scope, and explicit PII gating.\n\n## Idea Organization and Prioritization\n\n**Thematic Organization:**\n\n**Theme 1: Trust Invariants & Guarantees**  \nFocus: What must always be true, and how guarantees are expressed.  \nIdeas: Invariant-First Scaffold, Trust Contract Five, Explicit Contract Surface, Deny by Default, No Silent Fallbacks, Honest Infrastructure.\n\n**Theme 2: Scope & Capability Model**  \nFocus: Defining scope types, capabilities, and allowable transitions.  \nIdeas: Capability–Identity Separation, Scope–Operation Primitive Grid, Tenant Identity as an Operation, Host ≠ Tenant Null, Read-Only Reporting Scope, Job Scope as First-Class, Transition Gate Contracts.\n\n**Theme 3: Enforcement & Choke Points**  \nFocus: Where the system enforces invariants mechanically.  \nIdeas: Tenant Certainty Gate, Choke-Point Enforcement Layer, Deterministic Tenant Context Pipeline, No Middleware-Only Enforcement, No Implicit Tenant Inference, No Tenant-Null State.\n\n**Theme 4: Privilege & Governance**  \nFocus: How power is granted, constrained, and reviewed.  \nIdeas: Frictionful Privileged Scope, Reviewable Power, Privileged Path Least Convenient, No Global Admins, No Unbounded Cross-Tenant Ops, PII Access as a Dedicated Gate.\n\n**Theme 5: Proof, Evidence & Onboarding**  \nFocus: Making guarantees provable and learnable.  \nIdeas: Provable Architecture, Contract Tests First, Docs from Policy, Trust from Day One, Onboard by Failure, Operational Truth, Compliance Evidence Generator.\n\n**Theme 6: Positioning & Lifecycle Leverage**  \nFocus: How the trust kernel scales across lifecycle and messaging.  \nIdeas: Trust-First Kernel, Trust Foundation Trio, Tenancy as OS, Safe by Default/Usable by Design, Intentional Governance, Policy Kernel Validates Modules, Boundary-First Data Modeling, Migration Safety Net, Incident Response Safety Gear, Agent Containment Infrastructure, Trust Marketing Backed by Code, No Feature Bundling Baseline, Guardrails Over Flexibility, No Mixed-Scope Execution, No Casual Cross-Tenant Utilities, Scope Before Auth, Invariants Before Domain.\n\n**Prioritization Results:**\n\n- **Top Priority Ideas:** Theme 1 (Trust Invariants & Guarantees), Theme 2 (Scope & Capability Model), Theme 3 (Enforcement & Choke Points).\n- **Secondary Themes:** Theme 5 (Proof, Evidence & Onboarding), Theme 4 (Privilege & Governance).\n- **Positioning Focus (later):** Theme 6 (Positioning & Lifecycle Leverage).\n\n**Action Planning:**\n\n1. **Define Trust Invariants & Guarantees**\n   - Draft the non-negotiable trust contract (what is guaranteed and what is not).\n   - Establish kill criteria for features that dilute or bypass guarantees.\n   - Encode the contract as a short, explicit baseline spec.\n\n2. **Formalize Scope & Capability Model**\n   - Specify scope types, allowed operations, and transition rules.\n   - Build the capability matrix (scope × operation) as source of truth.\n   - Identify which operations require explicit elevation and audit metadata.\n\n3. **Implement Enforcement at Choke Points**\n   - Identify write/query boundaries and job execution entry points.\n   - Define deterministic tenant resolution and conflict-fail rules.\n   - Add contract tests that prove invariants hold at these boundaries.\n\n## Session Summary and Insights\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n- Established a trust-first thesis with explicit non-negotiable guarantees.\n- Defined a scope calculus and operation matrix for consistent governance.\n- Anchored enforcement at chokepoints with provable invariants.\n- Clarified prioritization that prevents feature gravity.\n\n**Session Reflections:**\n\nThis session converged quickly on a trust-kernel identity. The strongest value is not in a feature set, but in a minimal, explicit contract enforced by scope and proven at boundaries.\n"}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(web app, API, mobile, etc.)\n- What domain does it operate in? (healthcare, fintech, e-commerce, etc.)\n- What's the project context? (greenfield new product vs brownfield existing system)\n- How complex is this domain? (low, medium, high)\n\n## DISCOVERY SEQUENCE:\n\n### 1. Check Document State\n\nRead the frontmatter from `{outputFile}` to get document counts:\n- `briefCount` - Product briefs available\n- `researchCount` - Research documents available\n- `brainstormingCount` - Brainstorming docs available\n- `projectDocsCount` - Existing project documentation\n\n**Announce your understanding:**\n\n\"From step 1, I have loaded:\n- Product briefs: {{briefCount}}\n- Research: {{researchCount}}\n- Brainstorming: {{brainstormingCount}}\n- Project docs: {{projectDocsCount}}\n\n{{if projectDocsCount > 0}}This is a brownfield project - I'll focus on understanding what you want to add or change.{{else}}This is a greenfield project - I'll help you define the full product vision.{{/if}}\"\n\n### 2. Load Classification Data\n\n**Attempt subprocess data lookup:**\n\n**Project Type Lookup:**\n\"Your task: Lookup data in {projectTypesCSV}\n\n**Search criteria:**\n- Find row where project_type matches {{detectedProjectType}}\n\n**Return format:**\nReturn ONLY the matching row as a YAML-formatted object with these fields:\nproject_type, detection_signals\n\n**Do NOT return the entire CSV - only the matching row.**\"\n\n**Domain Complexity Lookup:**\n\"Your task: Lookup data in {domainComplexityCSV}\n\n**Search criteria:**\n- Find row where domain matches {{detectedDomain}}\n\n**Return format:**\nReturn ONLY the matching row as a YAML-formatted object with these fields:\ndomain, complexity, typical_concerns, compliance_requirements\n\n**Do NOT return the entire CSV - only the matching row.**\"\n\n**Graceful degradation (if Task tool unavailable):**\n- Load the CSV files directly\n- Find the matching rows manually\n- Extract required fields\n- Keep in memory for intelligent classification\n\n### 3. Begin Discovery Conversation\n\n**Start with what you know:**\n\nIf the user has a product brief or project docs, acknowledge them and share your understanding. Then ask clarifying questions to deepen your understanding.\n\nIf this is a greenfield project with no docs, start with open-ended discovery:\n- What problem does this solve?\n- Who's it for?\n- What excites you about building this?\n\n**Listen for classification signals:**\n\nAs the user describes their product, match against:\n- **Project type signals** (API, mobile, SaaS, etc.)\n- **Domain signals** (healthcare, fintech, education, etc.)\n- **Complexity indicators** (regulated industries, novel technology, etc.)\n\n### 4. Confirm Classification\n\nOnce you have enough understanding, share your classification:\n\n\"I'm hearing this as:\n- **Project Type:** {{detectedType}}\n- **Domain:** {{detectedDomain}}\n- **Complexity:** {{complexityLevel}}\n\nDoes this sound right to you?\"\n\nLet the user confirm or refine your classification.\n\n### 5. Save Classification to Frontmatter\n\nWhen user selects 'C', update frontmatter with classification:\n```yaml\nclassification:\n  projectType: {{projectType}}\n  domain: {{domain}}\n  complexity: {{complexityLevel}}\n  projectContext: {{greenfield|brownfield}}\n```\n\n### N. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the project classification for review, then display menu:\n\n\"Based on our conversation, I've discovered and classified your project.\n\n**Here's the classification:**\n\n**Project Type:** {{detectedType}}\n**Domain:** {{detectedDomain}}\n**Complexity:** {{complexityLevel}}\n**Project Context:** {{greenfield|brownfield}}\n\n**What would you like to do?**\"\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Product Vision (Step 2b of 13)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the current classification, process the enhanced insights that come back, ask user if they accept the improvements, if yes update classification then redisplay menu, if no keep original classification then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow} with the current classification, process the collaborative insights, ask user if they accept the changes, if yes update classification then redisplay menu, if no keep original classification then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Save classification to {outputFile} frontmatter, add this step name to the end of stepsCompleted array, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [classification saved to frontmatter], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to explore product vision.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Document state checked and announced to user\n- Classification data loaded and used intelligently\n- Natural conversation to understand project type, domain, complexity\n- Classification validated with user before saving\n- Frontmatter updated with classification when C selected\n- User's existing documents acknowledged and built upon\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not reading documentCounts from frontmatter first\n- Skipping classification data loading\n- Generating executive summary or vision content (that's later steps!)\n- Not validating classification with user\n- Being prescriptive instead of having natural conversation\n- Proceeding without user selecting 'C'\n\n**Master Rule:** This is classification and understanding only. No content generation yet. Build on what the user already has. Have natural conversations, don't follow scripts.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Begin Success Definition Conversation\n\n**Check Input Documents for Success Indicators:**\nAnalyze product brief, research, and brainstorming documents for success criteria already mentioned.\n\n**If Input Documents Contain Success Criteria:**\nGuide user to refine existing success criteria:\n- Acknowledge what's already documented in their materials\n- Extract key success themes from brief, research, and brainstorming\n- Help user identify gaps and areas for expansion\n- Probe for specific, measurable outcomes: When do users feel delighted/relieved/empowered?\n- Ask about emotional success moments and completion scenarios\n- Explore what \"worth it\" means beyond what's already captured\n\n**If No Success Criteria in Input Documents:**\nStart with user-centered success exploration:\n- Guide conversation toward defining what \"worth it\" means for users\n- Ask about the moment users realize their problem is solved\n- Explore specific user outcomes and emotional states\n- Identify success \"aha!\" moments and completion scenarios\n- Focus on user experience of success first\n\n### 2. Explore User Success Metrics\n\nListen for specific user outcomes and help make them measurable:\n\n- Guide from vague to specific: NOT \"users are happy\" → \"users complete [key action] within [timeframe]\"\n- Ask about emotional success: \"When do they feel delighted/relieved/empowered?\"\n- Identify success moments: \"What's the 'aha!' moment?\"\n- Define completion scenarios: \"What does 'done' look like for the user?\"\n\n### 3. Define Business Success\n\nTransition to business metrics:\n- Guide conversation to business perspective on success\n- Explore timelines: What does 3-month success look like? 12-month success?\n- Identify key business metrics: revenue, user growth, engagement, or other measures?\n- Ask what specific metric would indicate \"this is working\"\n- Understand business success from their perspective\n\n### 4. Challenge Vague Metrics\n\nPush for specificity on business metrics:\n\n- \"10,000 users\" → \"What kind of users? Doing what?\"\n- \"99.9% uptime\" → \"What's the real concern - data loss? Failed payments?\"\n- \"Fast\" → \"How fast, and what specifically needs to be fast?\"\n- \"Good adoption\" → \"What percentage adoption by when?\"\n\n### 5. Connect to Product Differentiator\n\nTie success metrics back to what makes the product special:\n- Connect success criteria to the product's unique differentiator\n- Ensure metrics reflect the specific value proposition\n- Adapt success criteria to domain context:\n  - Consumer: User love, engagement, retention\n  - B2B: ROI, efficiency, adoption\n  - Developer tools: Developer experience, community\n  - Regulated: Compliance, safety, validation\n  - GovTech: Government compliance, accessibility, procurement\n\n### 6. Smart Scope Negotiation\n\nGuide scope definition through success lens:\n- Help user distinguish MVP (must work to be useful) from growth (competitive) and vision (dream)\n- Guide conversation through three scope levels:\n  1. MVP: What's essential for proving the concept?\n  2. Growth: What makes it competitive?\n  3. Vision: What's the dream version?\n- Challenge scope creep conversationally: Could this wait until after launch? Is this essential for MVP?\n- For complex domains: Ensure compliance minimums are included in MVP\n\n### 7. Generate Success Criteria Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n[Content about user success criteria based on conversation]\n\n### Business Success\n\n[Content about business success metrics based on conversation]\n\n### Technical Success\n\n[Content about technical success requirements based on conversation]\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n[Content about specific measurable outcomes based on conversation]\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n[Content about MVP scope based on conversation]\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n[Content about growth features based on conversation]\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n[Content about future vision based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 8. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the success criteria content for user review, then display menu:\n\n- Show the drafted success criteria and scope definition (using structure from section 7)\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of the conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to User Journey Mapping (Step 4 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the current success criteria content, process the enhanced success metrics that come back, ask user \"Accept these improvements to the success criteria?

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Leverage Existing Users & Identify Additional Types\n\n**Check Input Documents for Existing Personas:**\nAnalyze product brief, research, and brainstorming documents for user personas already defined.\n\n**If User Personas Exist in Input Documents:**\nGuide user to build on existing personas:\n- Acknowledge personas found in their product brief\n- Extract key persona details and backstories\n- Leverage existing insights about their needs\n- Prompt to identify additional user types beyond those documented\n- Suggest additional user types based on product context (admins, moderators, support, API consumers, internal ops)\n- Ask what additional user types should be considered\n\n**If No Personas in Input Documents:**\nStart with comprehensive user type discovery:\n- Guide exploration of ALL people who interact with the system\n- Consider beyond primary users: admins, moderators, support staff, API consumers, internal ops\n- Ask what user types should be mapped for this specific product\n- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all system interactions\n\n### 2. Create Narrative Story-Based Journeys\n\nFor each user type, create compelling narrative journeys that tell their story:\n\n#### Narrative Journey Creation Process:\n\n**If Using Existing Persona from Input Documents:**\nGuide narrative journey creation:\n- Use persona's existing backstory from brief\n- Explore how the product changes their life/situation\n- Craft journey narrative: where do we meet them, how does product help them write their next chapter?\n\n**If Creating New Persona:**\nGuide persona creation with story framework:\n- Name: realistic name and personality\n- Situation: What's happening in their life/work that creates need?\n- Goal: What do they desperately want to achieve?\n- Obstacle: What's standing in their way?\n- Solution: How does the product solve their story?\n\n**Story-Based Journey Mapping:**\n\nGuide narrative journey creation using story structure:\n- **Opening Scene**: Where/how do we meet them? What's their current pain?\n- **Rising Action**: What steps do they take? What do they discover?\n- **Climax**: Critical moment where product delivers real value\n- **Resolution**: How does their situation improve? What's their new reality?\n\nEncourage narrative format with specific user details, emotional journey, and clear before/after contrast\n\n### 3. Guide Journey Exploration\n\nFor each journey, facilitate detailed exploration:\n- What happens at each step specifically?\n- What could go wrong? What's the recovery path?\n- What information do they need to see/hear?\n- What's their emotional state at each point?\n- Where does this journey succeed or fail?\n\n### 4. Connect Journeys to Requirements\n\nAfter each journey, explicitly state:\n- This journey reveals requirements for specific capability areas\n- Help user see how different journeys create different feature sets\n- Connect journey needs to concrete capabilities (onboarding, dashboards, notifications, etc.)\n\n### 5. Aim for Comprehensive Coverage\n\nGuide toward complete journey set:\n\n- **Primary user** - happy path (core experience)\n- **Primary user** - edge case (different goal, error recovery)\n- **Secondary user** (admin, moderator, support, etc.)\n- **API consumer** (if applicable)\n\nAsk if additional journeys are needed to cover uncovered user types\n\n### 6. Generate User Journey Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## User Journeys\n\n[All journey narratives based on conversation]\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n[Summary of capabilities revealed by journeys based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the user journey content for review, then display menu:\n- Show the mapped user journeys (using structure from section 6)\n- Highlight how each journey reveals different capabilities\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Domain Requirements (Step 5 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the current journey content, process the enhanced journey insights that come back, ask user \"Accept these improvements to the user journeys? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow} with the current journeys, process the collaborative journey improvements and additions, ask user \"Accept these changes to the user journeys? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing personas from product briefs leveraged when available\n✅ All user types identified (not just primary users)\n✅ Rich narrative storytelling for each persona and journey\n✅ Complete story-based journey mapping with emotional arc\n✅ Journey requirements clearly connected to capabilities needed\n✅ Minimum 3-4 compelling narrative journeys covering different user types\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Ignoring existing personas from product briefs\n❌ Only mapping primary user journeys and missing secondary users\n❌ Creating generic journeys without rich persona details and narrative\n❌ Missing emotional storytelling elements that make journeys compelling\n❌ Missing critical decision points and failure scenarios\n❌ Not connecting journeys to required capabilities\n❌ Not having enough journey diversity (admin, support, API, etc.)\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## JOURNEY TYPES TO ENSURE:\n\n**Minimum Coverage:**\n\n1. **Primary User - Success Path**: Core experience journey\n2. **Primary User - Edge Case**: Error recovery, alternative goals\n3. **Admin/Operations User**: Management, configuration, monitoring\n4. **Support/Troubleshooting**: Help, investigation, issue resolution\n5. **API/Integration** (if applicable): Developer/technical user journey\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-05-domain.md`.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-05 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Secondary — Founder / early builder adopting at project start**\n\n**Keep.**\nThis shows:\n\n* early leverage,\n* low cognitive overhead,\n* and why starting “right” doesn’t slow momentum.\n\nTone should be **practical and outcome-focused**, not idealistic or preachy.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Support / Ops — Security or compliance stakeholder reviewing guarantees**\n\n**Keep.**\nThis journey reframes TenantSaas as:\n\n* evidence-producing,\n* explainable,\n* and credible beyond engineering.\n\nTone should be **formal, inspectable, and concrete**. No marketing language.\n\n---\n\n### **5. API / Integration — Contributor extending or adapting the core**\n\n**Keep.**\nThis is important for:\n\n* ecosystem viability,\n* long-term sustainability,\n* and proving the core is intentionally small but extensible.\n\nTone should be **respectful of constraints**, showing how extensions align rather than fork.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Optional — New engineer onboarding into an existing system**\n\n**Optional but valuable.**\nThis journey highlights:\n\n* learning-by-constraints,\n* reduced tribal knowledge,\n* and durability of the mental model.\n\nIf included, keep it **brief and observational**, not tutorial-heavy.\n\n---\n\n## Narrative tone constraints (important)\n\nAcross all journeys:\n\n* **No hero narratives**\n  The system helps quietly; it doesn’t “save the day.”\n\n* **No fear-based framing**\n  Avoid “catastrophic failure” language except where strictly factual.\n\n* **No marketing superlatives**\n  Use calm, professional, matter-of-fact language.\n\n* **Show restraint and refusal**\n  Moments where the system says “no” or requires explicit intent are key.\n\n* **Emphasize normalcy**\n  TenantSaas should feel like infrastructure, not a special workflow.\n\n---\n\n## Summary recommendation\n\n**Keep your original five.**\nAdd the sixth only if you want to explicitly show onboarding benefits.\n\nThis set covers:\n\n* design-time,\n* run-time,\n* failure-time,\n* governance-time,\n* and evolution-time interactions.\n\nThat’s a complete narrative surface for the product without bloating the brief.","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

I’ll include the new‑engineer onboarding journey as a constraint/acceptance signal, not a primary requirement. I’ll choose neutral names.\n\nHere’s the drafted journey content (aligned to your tone constraints):\n\n```markdown\n## User Journeys\n\n### 1) Platform engineer integrating TenantSaas into a new service\n\n**Opening scene:** Maya owns platform standards and is starting a new service in a growing SaaS stack. She’s wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.  \n**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.  \n**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution.

She’s wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.  \n**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.  \n**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution. It forces a decision at design time, not after launch.  \n**Resolution:** Maya adopts the trust contract as a shared team standard. The new service fits into existing architecture without special cases, and future services reuse the same baseline without re‑debate.\n\n### 2) On-call responder using elevated scope during an incident (edge case)\n\n**Opening scene:** Jordan is on call when a cross‑tenant data correction is required under time pressure.  \n**Rising action:** Jordan attempts a privileged operation; the system requires explicit scope elevation with clear intent, not silent admin access.  \n**Climax:** The system allows the operation only through a constrained path that is visible and auditable, avoiding accidental overreach.  \n**Resolution:** The fix is applied quickly without bypassing the baseline.

She is wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.\n+**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.\n+**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution. It forces a decision at design time, not after launch.\n+**Resolution:** Maya adopts the trust contract as a shared team standard. The new service fits into existing architecture without special cases, and future services reuse the same baseline without re-debate.\n+\n+### 2) On-call responder using elevated scope during an incident (edge case)\n+\n+**Opening scene:** Jordan is on call when a cross-tenant data correction is required under time pressure.\n+**Rising action:** Jordan attempts a privileged operation; the system requires explicit scope elevation with clear intent, not silent admin access.\n+**Climax:** The system allows the operation only through a constrained path that is visible and auditable, avoiding accidental overreach.\n+**Resolution:** The fix is applied quickly without bypassing the baseline. The incident is resolved and the audit trail is clean, with no special exceptions introduced.\n+\n+### 3) Founder / early builder adopting at project start\n+\n+**Opening scene:** Priya is starting a new SaaS product and wants to avoid fixing multi-tenancy later.\n+**Rising action:** She adds TenantSaas early because it is small, explicit, and does not prescribe a full framework.\n+**Climax:** The baseline forces clarity around tenant context at the first integration point, and Priya realizes she does not need to invent her own conventions.\n+**Resolution:** The team moves fast with confidence, knowing the core assumptions are locked in without slowing momentum.\n+\n+### 4) Security/compliance stakeholder reviewing guarantees\n+\n+**Opening scene:** Alex is asked to assess tenant isolation guarantees before an external review.\n+**Rising action:** Alex inspects the trust contract and verification artifacts rather than chasing tribal knowledge.\n+**Climax:** The evidence shows invariants enforced at unavoidable choke points, with contract tests that can be executed in CI.\n+**Resolution:** Alex can approve the baseline as a credible control, because the guarantees are explicit and verifiable, not implied.\n+\n+### 5) API/integration contributor extending or adapting the core\n+\n+**Opening scene:** Sam wants to create an adapter for a different stack while keeping the core intact.\n+**Rising action:** Sam reviews the constraints and sees where extensions are allowed versus where invariants are non-negotiable.\n+**Climax:** The adapter integrates through the sanctioned boundary and inherits the same guarantees without widening the core API.\n+**Resolution:** The extension adds reach without fragmenting the baseline, and the core remains intentionally small.\n+\n+### 6) New engineer onboarding into an existing system (acceptance signal)\n+\n+**Opening scene:** Riley joins an existing team mid-project.\n+**Rising action:** Riley reads the baseline code and its contract tests rather than relying on oral history.\n+**Climax:** A constrained operation makes the rules explicit, and the correct pattern is discoverable in code.\n+**Resolution:** Onboarding requires fewer explanations, which acts as an acceptance signal that the baseline is doing its job.\n+\n+### Journey Requirements Summary\n+\n+- A single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context.\n+- Explicit tenant attribution required before operations proceed.\n+- Controlled, auditable elevation paths for privileged actions.\n+- A clear, inspectable trust contract with runnable verification tests.\n+- An extension model that preserves invariants and keeps the core small.\n+- Baseline conventions are discoverable in code, not tribal knowledge.\n*** End Patch"}}

Check Domain Complexity\n\n**Review classification from step-02:**\n\n- What's the domain complexity level? (low/medium/high)\n- What's the specific domain? (healthcare, fintech, education, etc.)\n\n**If complexity is LOW:**\n\nOffer to skip:\n\"The domain complexity from our discovery is low. We may not need deep domain-specific requirements. Would you like to:\n- [C] Skip this step and move to Innovation\n- [D] Do domain exploration anyway\"\n\n**If complexity is MEDIUM or HIGH:**\n\nProceed with domain exploration.\n\n### 2.

Explore Domain-Specific Concerns\n\n**Start with what you know:**\n\nAcknowledge the domain and explore what makes it complex:\n- What regulations apply? (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOX, etc.)\n- What standards matter? (ISO, NIST, domain-specific standards)\n- What certifications are needed? (security, privacy, domain-specific)\n- What integrations are required? (EMR systems, payment processors, etc.)\n\n**Explore technical constraints:**\n- Security requirements (encryption, audit logs, access control)\n- Privacy requirements (data handling, consent, retention)\n- Performance requirements (real-time, batch, latency)\n- Availability requirements (uptime, disaster recovery)\n\n### 4. Document Domain Requirements\n\n**Structure the requirements around key concerns:**\n\n```markdown\n### Compliance & Regulatory\n- [Specific requirements]\n\n### Technical Constraints\n- [Security, privacy, performance needs]\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- [Required systems and data flows]\n\n### Risk Mitigations\n- [Domain-specific risks and how to address them]\n```\n\n### 5.

Listen for Innovation Indicators\n\nMonitor conversation for both general and project-type-specific innovation signals:\n\n#### General Innovation Language:\n\n- \"Nothing like this exists\"\n- \"We're rethinking how [X] works\"\n- \"Combining [A] with [B] for the first time\"\n- \"Novel approach to [problem]\"\n- \"No one has done [concept] before\"\n\n#### Project-Type-Specific Signals (from CSV):\n\nMatch user descriptions against innovation_signals for their project_type:\n\n- **api_backend**: \"API composition;New protocol\"\n- **mobile_app**: \"Gesture innovation;AR/VR features\"\n- **saas_b2b**: \"Workflow automation;AI agents\"\n- **developer_tool**: \"New paradigm;DSL creation\"\n\n### 3. Initial Innovation Screening\n\nAsk targeted innovation discovery questions:\n- Guide exploration of what makes the product innovative\n- Explore if they're challenging existing assumptions\n- Ask about novel combinations of technologies/approaches\n- Identify what hasn't been done before\n- Understand which aspects feel most innovative\n\n### 4. Deep Innovation Exploration (If Detected)\n\nIf innovation signals are found, explore deeply:\n\n#### Innovation Discovery Questions:\n- What makes it unique compared to existing solutions?\n- What assumption are you challenging?\n- How do we validate it works?\n- What's the fallback if it doesn't?\n- Has anyone tried this before?\n\n#### Market Context Research:\n\nIf relevant innovation detected, consider web search for context:\nUse `web_search_triggers` from project-type CSV:\n`[web_search_triggers] {concept} innovations {date}`\n\n### 5. Generate Innovation Content (If Innovation Detected)\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n\n[Innovation patterns identified based on conversation]\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n\n[Market context and research based on conversation]\n\n### Validation Approach\n\n[Validation methodology based on conversation]\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n\n[Innovation risks and fallbacks based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS (Only if Innovation Detected)\n\nPresent the innovation content for review, then display menu:\n- Show identified innovative aspects (using structure from section 5)\n- Highlight differentiation from existing solutions\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Project Type Analysis (Step 7 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the current innovation content, process the enhanced innovation insights that come back, ask user \"Accept these improvements to the innovation analysis?

Conduct Guided Discovery Using Key Questions\n\nParse `key_questions` from CSV and explore each:\n\n#### Question-Based Discovery:\n\nFor each question in `key_questions` from CSV:\n\n- Ask the user naturally in conversational style\n- Listen for their response and ask clarifying follow-ups\n- Connect answers to product value proposition\n\n**Example Flow:**\nIf key_questions = \"Endpoints needed?;Authentication method?;Data formats?;Rate limits?;Versioning?;SDK needed?\"\n\nAsk naturally:\n\n- \"What are the main endpoints your API needs to expose?\"\n- \"How will you handle authentication and authorization?\"\n- \"What data formats will you support for requests and responses?\"\n\n### 3. Document Project-Type Specific Requirements\n\nBased on user answers to key_questions, synthesize comprehensive requirements:\n\n#### Requirement Categories:\n\nCover the areas indicated by `required_sections` from CSV:\n\n- Synthesize what was discovered for each required section\n- Document specific requirements, constraints, and decisions\n- Connect to product differentiator when relevant\n\n#### Skip Irrelevant Sections:\n\nSkip areas indicated by `skip_sections` from CSV to avoid wasting time on irrelevant aspects.\n\n### 4. Generate Dynamic Content Sections\n\nParse `required_sections` list from the matched CSV row. For each section name, generate corresponding content:\n\n#### Common CSV Section Mappings:\n\n- \"endpoint_specs\" or \"endpoint_specification\" → API endpoints documentation\n- \"auth_model\" or \"authentication_model\" → Authentication approach\n- \"platform_reqs\" or \"platform_requirements\" → Platform support needs\n- \"device_permissions\" or \"device_features\" → Device capabilities\n- \"tenant_model\" → Multi-tenancy approach\n- \"rbac_matrix\" or \"permission_matrix\" → Permission structure\n\n#### Template Variable Strategy:\n\n- For sections matching common template variables: generate specific content\n- For sections without template matches: include in main project_type_requirements\n- Hybrid approach balances template structure with CSV-driven flexibility\n\n### 5. Generate Project-Type Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## [Project Type] Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\n[Project type summary based on conversation]\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n[Technical architecture requirements based on conversation]\n\n[Dynamic sections based on CSV and conversation]\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n[Implementation specific requirements based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the project-type content for review, then display menu:\n\n\"Based on our conversation and best practices for this product type, I've documented the {project_type}-specific requirements for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from section 5]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\"\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Scoping (Step 8 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the current project-type content, process the enhanced technical insights that come back, ask user \"Accept these improvements to the technical requirements? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow} with the current project-type requirements, process the collaborative technical expertise and validation, ask user \"Accept these changes to the technical requirements? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from previous steps.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Project-type configuration loaded and used effectively\n✅ All key questions from CSV explored with user input\n✅ Required sections generated per CSV configuration\n✅ Skip sections properly avoided to save time\n✅ Technical requirements connected to product value\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not loading or using project-type CSV configuration\n❌ Missing key questions from CSV in discovery process\n❌ Not generating required sections per CSV configuration\n❌ Documenting sections that should be skipped per CSV\n❌ Creating generic content without project-type specificity\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## PROJECT-TYPE EXAMPLES:\n\n**For api_backend:**\n\n- Focus on endpoints, authentication, data schemas, rate limiting\n- Skip visual design and user journey sections\n- Generate API specification documentation\n\n**For mobile_app:**\n\n- Focus on platform requirements, device permissions, offline mode\n- Skip API endpoint documentation unless needed\n- Generate mobile-specific technical requirements\n\n**For saas_b2b:**\n\n- Focus on multi-tenancy, permissions, integrations\n- Skip mobile-first considerations unless relevant\n- Generate enterprise-specific requirements\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `{nextStepFile}` to define project scope.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-08 (Scoping) until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Review Current PRD State\n\nAnalyze everything documented so far:\n- Present synthesis of established vision, success criteria, journeys\n- Assess domain and innovation focus\n- Evaluate scope implications: simple MVP, medium, or complex project\n- Ask if initial assessment feels right or if they see it differently\n\n### 2. Define MVP Strategy\n\nFacilitate strategic MVP decisions:\n- Explore MVP philosophy options: problem-solving, experience, platform, or revenue MVP\n- Ask critical questions:\n  - What's the minimum that would make users say 'this is useful'?\n  - What would make investors/partners say 'this has potential'?\n  - What's the fastest path to validated learning?\n- Guide toward appropriate MVP approach for their product\n\n### 3. Scoping Decision Framework\n\nUse structured decision-making for scope:\n\n**Must-Have Analysis:**\n- Guide identification of absolute MVP necessities\n- For each journey and success criterion, ask:\n  - Without this, does the product fail?\n  - Can this be manual initially?\n  - Is this a deal-breaker for early adopters?\n- Analyze journeys for MVP essentials\n\n**Nice-to-Have Analysis:**\n- Identify what could be added later:\n  - Features that enhance but aren't essential\n  - User types that can be added later\n  - Advanced functionality that builds on MVP\n- Ask what features could be added in versions 2, 3, etc.\n\n### 4. Progressive Feature Roadmap\n\nCreate phased development approach:\n- Guide mapping of features across development phases\n- Structure as Phase 1 (MVP), Phase 2 (Growth), Phase 3 (Vision)\n- Ensure clear progression and dependencies\n\n- Core user value delivery\n- Essential user journeys\n- Basic functionality that works reliably\n\n**Phase 2: Growth**\n\n- Additional user types\n- Enhanced features\n- Scale improvements\n\n**Phase 3: Expansion**\n\n- Advanced capabilities\n- Platform features\n- New markets or use cases\n\n**Where does your current vision fit in this development sequence?**\"\n\n### 5. Risk-Based Scoping\n\nIdentify and mitigate scoping risks:\n\n**Technical Risks:**\n\"Looking at your innovation and domain requirements:\n\n- What's the most technically challenging aspect?\n- Could we simplify the initial implementation?\n- What's the riskiest assumption about technology feasibility?\"\n\n**Market Risks:**\n\n- What's the biggest market risk?\n- How does the MVP address this?\n- What learning do we need to de-risk this?\"\n\n**Resource Risks:**\n\n- What if we have fewer resources than planned?\n- What's the absolute minimum team size needed?\n- Can we launch with a smaller feature set?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Scoping Content\n\nPrepare comprehensive scoping section:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** {{chosen_mvp_approach}}\n**Resource Requirements:** {{mvp_team_size_and_skills}}\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n{{essential_journeys_for_mvp}}\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n{{list_of_essential_mvp_features}}\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n{{planned_growth_features}}\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n{{planned_expansion_features}}\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** {{mitigation_approach}}\n**Market Risks:** {{validation_approach}}\n**Resource Risks:** {{contingency_approach}}\n```\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the scoping decisions for review, then display menu:\n- Show strategic scoping plan (using structure from step 6)\n- Highlight MVP boundaries and phased roadmap\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Functional Requirements (Step 9 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the current scoping analysis, process the enhanced insights that come back, ask user if they accept the improvements, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow} with the scoping context, process the collaborative insights on MVP and roadmap decisions, ask user if they accept the changes, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Complete PRD document analyzed for scope implications\n✅ Strategic MVP approach defined and justified\n✅ Clear MVP feature boundaries established\n✅ Phased development roadmap created\n✅ Key risks identified and mitigation strategies defined\n✅ User explicitly agrees to scope decisions\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not analyzing the complete PRD before making scoping decisions\n❌ Making scope decisions without strategic rationale\n❌ Not getting explicit user agreement on MVP boundaries\n❌ Missing critical risk analysis\n❌ Not creating clear phased development approach\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load {nextStepFile}.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-09 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Understand FR Purpose and Usage\n\nStart by explaining the critical role of functional requirements:\n\n**Purpose:**\nFRs define WHAT capabilities the product must have. They are the complete inventory of user-facing and system capabilities that deliver the product vision.\n\n**Critical Properties:**\n✅ Each FR is a testable capability\n✅ Each FR is implementation-agnostic (could be built many ways)\n✅ Each FR specifies WHO and WHAT, not HOW\n✅ No UI details, no performance numbers, no technology choices\n✅ Comprehensive coverage of capability areas\n\n**How They Will Be Used:**\n\n1. UX Designer reads FRs → designs interactions for each capability\n2. Architect reads FRs → designs systems to support each capability\n3. PM reads FRs → creates epics and stories to implement each capability\n\n### 2. Review Existing Content for Capability Extraction\n\nSystematically review all previous sections to extract capabilities:\n\n**Extract From:**\n\n- Executive Summary → Core product differentiator capabilities\n- Success Criteria → Success-enabling capabilities\n- User Journeys → Journey-revealed capabilities\n- Domain Requirements → Compliance and regulatory capabilities\n- Innovation Patterns → Innovative feature capabilities\n- Project-Type Requirements → Technical capability needs\n\n### 3. Organize Requirements by Capability Area\n\nGroup FRs by logical capability areas (NOT by technology or layer):\n\n**Good Grouping Examples:**\n\n- ✅ \"User Management\" (not \"Authentication System\")\n- ✅ \"Content Discovery\" (not \"Search Algorithm\")\n- ✅ \"Team Collaboration\" (not \"WebSocket Infrastructure\")\n\n**Target 5-8 Capability Areas** for typical projects.\n\n### 4. Generate Comprehensive FR List\n\nCreate complete functional requirements using this format:\n\n**Format:**\n\n- FR#: [Actor] can [capability] [context/constraint if needed]\n- Number sequentially (FR1, FR2, FR3...)\n- Aim for 20-50 FRs for typical projects\n\n**Altitude Check:**\nEach FR should answer \"WHAT capability exists?\" NOT \"HOW it's implemented?\"\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- ✅ \"Users can customize appearance settings\"\n- ❌ \"Users can toggle light/dark theme with 3 font size options stored in LocalStorage\"\n\n### 5. Self-Validation Process\n\nBefore presenting to user, validate the FR list:\n\n**Completeness Check:**\n\n1. \"Did I cover EVERY capability mentioned in the MVP scope section?\"\n2. \"Did I include domain-specific requirements as FRs?\"\n3. \"Did I cover the project-type specific needs?\"\n4. \"Could a UX designer read ONLY the FRs and know what to design?\"\n5. \"Could an Architect read ONLY the FRs and know what to support?\"\n6. \"Are there any user actions or system behaviors we discussed that have no FR?\"\n\n**Altitude Check:**\n\n1. \"Am I stating capabilities (WHAT) or implementation (HOW)?\"\n2. \"Am I listing acceptance criteria or UI specifics?\" (Remove if yes)\n3. \"Could this FR be implemented 5 different ways?\" (Good - means it's not prescriptive)\n\n**Quality Check:**\n\n1. \"Is each FR clear enough that someone could test whether it exists?\"\n2. \"Is each FR independent (not dependent on reading other FRs to understand)?\"\n3. \"Did I avoid vague terms like 'good', 'fast', 'easy'?\" (Use NFRs for quality attributes)\n\n### 6. Generate Functional Requirements Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### [Capability Area Name]\n\n- FR1: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n- FR2: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n- FR3: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n\n### [Another Capability Area]\n\n- FR4: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n- FR5: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n\n[Continue for all capability areas discovered in conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the functional requirements for review, then display menu:\n- Show synthesized functional requirements (using structure from step 6)\n- Emphasize this is the capability contract for all downstream work\n- Highlight that every feature must trace back to these requirements\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\n**What would you like to do?**\"\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Non-Functional Requirements (Step 10 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the current FR list, process the enhanced capability coverage that comes back, ask user if they accept the additions, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow} with the current FR list, process the collaborative capability validation and additions, ask user if they accept the changes, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ All previous discovery content synthesized into FRs\n✅ FRs organized by capability areas (not technology)\n✅ Each FR states WHAT capability exists, not HOW to implement\n✅ Comprehensive coverage with 20-50 FRs typical\n✅ Altitude validation ensures implementation-agnostic requirements\n✅ Completeness check validates coverage of all discussed capabilities\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Missing capabilities from previous discovery sections\n❌ Organizing FRs by technology instead of capability areas\n❌ Including implementation details or UI specifics in FRs\n❌ Not achieving comprehensive coverage of discussed capabilities\n❌ Using vague terms instead of testable capabilities\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## CAPABILITY CONTRACT REMINDER:\n\nEmphasize to user: \"This FR list is now binding. Any feature not listed here will not exist in the final product unless we explicitly add it. This is why it's critical to ensure completeness now.\"\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load {nextStepFile} to define non-functional requirements.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-10 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

I’ll confirm it, make **one small adjustment**, and answer your three lock-questions directly.\n\n---\n\n## Confirmed capability areas (with one refinement)\n\nI would lock the Functional Requirements around **these seven areas**, with a slight rename to sharpen intent:\n\n1. **Tenant Context & Baseline Model**\n   ✔ Correct and essential. This is the conceptual and structural anchor.\n\n2. **Invariant Enforcement & Refusal Behavior**\n   ✔ Correct. This is where guarantees become mechanical.\n\n3. **Integration Point & Context Propagation**\n   ✔ Correct. This defines how the baseline actually enters a real system.\n\n4. **Verification & Contract Tests**\n   ✔ Correct. This is non-optional for credibility.\n\n5. **Documentation & Trust Contract**\n   ✔ Correct. This is part of the product, not supporting material.\n\n6. **Extensibility & Adapter Boundaries**\n   ✔ Correct, but important to frame narrowly:\n\n   * This is about *where extension is allowed*,\n   * not about providing extension mechanisms or plugins.\n\n7. **Developer Onboarding & Discoverability (as acceptance signals only)**\n   ✔ Correct **with your constraint explicitly stated**.\n   This must remain an *outcome constraint*, not a feature area.\n\n---\n\n## Answers to your lock questions\n\n### 1. Are there any missing capability areas?\n\n**No.**\nAt MVP level, this set is complete.\n\nNotably absent—and correctly so—are:\n\n* policy engines,\n* role systems,\n* lifecycle management,\n* observability,\n* runtime orchestration.\n\nThose would inflate scope and blur the product boundary.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Any capability you explicitly do NOT want to appear in the FR list?\n\nYes — and it’s important to be explicit about this in the PRD:\n\nDo **not** include capability areas such as:\n\n* “Tenant resolution strategies”\n* “Role-based access control”\n* “Admin tooling”\n* “Operational workflows”\n* “Domain policies”\n\nIf any of those appear as FR headers, it will signal drift toward a framework or platform.\n\nThey may appear later as:\n\n* examples,\n* extensions,\n* or documentation notes — **never as core FRs**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

I’ll confirm it, make **one small adjustment**, and answer your three lock-questions directly.\n\n---\n\n## Confirmed capability areas (with one refinement)\n\nI would lock the Functional Requirements around **these seven areas**, with a slight rename to sharpen intent:\n\n1. **Tenant Context & Baseline Model**\n   ✔ Correct and essential. This is the conceptual and structural anchor.\n\n2. **Invariant Enforcement & Refusal Behavior**\n   ✔ Correct. This is where guarantees become mechanical.\n\n3. **Integration Point & Context Propagation**\n   ✔ Correct. This defines how the baseline actually enters a real system.\n\n4. **Verification & Contract Tests**\n   ✔ Correct. This is non-optional for credibility.\n\n5. **Documentation & Trust Contract**\n   ✔ Correct. This is part of the product, not supporting material.\n\n6. **Extensibility & Adapter Boundaries**\n   ✔ Correct, but important to frame narrowly:\n\n   * This is about *where extension is allowed*,\n   * not about providing extension mechanisms or plugins.\n\n7. **Developer Onboarding & Discoverability (as acceptance signals only)**\n   ✔ Correct **with your constraint explicitly stated**.\n   This must remain an *outcome constraint*, not a feature area.\n\n---\n\n## Answers to your lock questions\n\n### 1. Are there any missing capability areas?\n\n**No.**\nAt MVP level, this set is complete.\n\nNotably absent—and correctly so—are:\n\n* policy engines,\n* role systems,\n* lifecycle management,\n* observability,\n* runtime orchestration.\n\nThose would inflate scope and blur the product boundary.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Any capability you explicitly do NOT want to appear in the FR list?\n\nYes — and it’s important to be explicit about this in the PRD:\n\nDo **not** include capability areas such as:\n\n* “Tenant resolution strategies”\n* “Role-based access control”\n* “Admin tooling”\n* “Operational workflows”\n* “Domain policies”\n\nIf any of those appear as FR headers, it will signal drift toward a framework or platform.\n\nThey may appear later as:\n\n* examples,\n* extensions,\n* or documentation notes — **never as core FRs**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Background jobs & admin/scripted paths — separate capability or not?\n\n**Do NOT make this a separate capability area.**\n\nIt should be **explicitly covered within**:\n\n* **Invariant Enforcement & Refusal Behavior**, and\n* **Integration Point & Context Propagation**\n\nWhy:\n\n* Jobs and scripts are *execution contexts*, not product capabilities.\n* Treating them separately implies special-case handling.\n* The architectural stance you’ve chosen is that **all execution paths are subject to the same invariants**.\n\nIn the FRs, this should appear as language like:\n\n> “Invariant enforcement and context requirements apply uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths.”\n\nThat keeps the model coherent.\n\n---\n\n## Final recommendation (lock this)\n\nYour Functional Requirements capability list should remain:\n\n1.

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Explain NFR Purpose and Scope\n\nStart by clarifying what NFRs are and why we're selective:\n\n**NFR Purpose:**\nNFRs define HOW WELL the system must perform, not WHAT it must do. They specify quality attributes like performance, security, scalability, etc.\n\n**Selective Approach:**\nWe only document NFRs that matter for THIS product. If a category doesn't apply, we skip it entirely. This prevents requirement bloat and focuses on what's actually important.\n\n### 2. Assess Product Context for NFR Relevance\n\nEvaluate which NFR categories matter based on product context:\n\n**Quick Assessment Questions:**\n\n- **Performance**: Is there user-facing impact of speed?\n- **Security**: Are we handling sensitive data or payments?\n- **Scalability**: Do we expect rapid user growth?\n- **Accessibility**: Are we serving broad public audiences?\n- **Integration**: Do we need to connect with other systems?\n- **Reliability**: Would downtime cause significant problems?\n\n### 3. Explore Relevant NFR Categories\n\nFor each relevant category, conduct targeted discovery:\n\n#### Performance NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore performance requirements:\n- What parts of the system need to be fast for users to be successful?\n- Are there specific response time expectations?\n- What happens if performance is slower than expected?\n- Are there concurrent user scenarios we need to support?\n\n#### Security NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore security requirements:\n- What data needs to be protected?\n- Who should have access to what?\n- What are the security risks we need to mitigate?\n- Are there compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?\n\n#### Scalability NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore scalability requirements:\n- How many users do we expect initially? Long-term?\n- Are there seasonal or event-based traffic spikes?\n- What happens if we exceed our capacity?\n- What growth scenarios should we plan for?\n\n#### Accessibility NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore accessibility requirements:\n- Are we serving users with visual, hearing, or motor impairments?\n- Are there legal accessibility requirements (WCAG, Section 508)?\n- What accessibility features are most important for our users?\n\n#### Integration NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore integration requirements:\n- What external systems do we need to connect with?\n- Are there APIs or data formats we must support?\n- How reliable do these integrations need to be?\n\n### 4. Make NFRs Specific and Measurable\n\nFor each relevant NFR category, ensure criteria are testable:\n\n**From Vague to Specific:**\n\n- NOT: \"The system should be fast\" → \"User actions complete within 2 seconds\"\n- NOT: \"The system should be secure\" → \"All data is encrypted at rest and in transit\"\n- NOT: \"The system should scale\" → \"System supports 10x user growth with <10% performance degradation\"\n\n### 5. Generate NFR Content (Only Relevant Categories)\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure (Dynamic based on relevance):\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections (only include sections that are relevant):\n\n```markdown\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Performance\n\n[Performance requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Security\n\n[Security requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Scalability\n\n[Scalability requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Accessibility\n\n[Accessibility requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Integration\n\n[Integration requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n```\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the non-functional requirements for review, then display menu:\n- Show defined NFRs (using structure from step 5)\n- Note that only relevant categories were included\n- Emphasize NFRs specify how well the system needs to perform\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Polish Document (Step 11 of 12)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the current NFR content, process the enhanced quality attribute insights that come back, ask user if they accept the improvements, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow} with the current NFR list, process the collaborative technical validation and additions, ask user if they accept the changes, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 5.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Only relevant NFR categories documented (no requirement bloat)\n✅ Each NFR is specific and measurable\n✅ NFRs connected to actual user needs and business context\n✅ Vague requirements converted to testable criteria\n✅ Domain-specific compliance requirements included if relevant\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Documenting NFR categories that don't apply to the product\n❌ Leaving requirements vague and unmeasurable\n❌ Not connecting NFRs to actual user or business needs\n❌ Missing domain-specific compliance requirements\n❌ Creating overly prescriptive technical requirements\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NFR CATEGORY GUIDANCE:\n\n**Include Performance When:**\n\n- User-facing response times impact success\n- Real-time interactions are critical\n- Performance is a competitive differentiator\n\n**Include Security When:**\n\n- Handling sensitive user data\n- Processing payments or financial information\n- Subject to compliance regulations\n- Protecting intellectual property\n\n**Include Scalability When:**\n\n- Expecting rapid user growth\n- Handling variable traffic patterns\n- Supporting enterprise-scale usage\n- Planning for market expansion\n\n**Include Accessibility When:**\n\n- Serving broad public audiences\n- Subject to accessibility regulations\n- Targeting users with disabilities\n- B2B customers with accessibility requirements\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load {nextStepFile} to finalize the PRD and complete the workflow.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-11 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Load Context and Document\n\n**CRITICAL:** Load the PRD purpose document first:\n\n- Read `{purposeFile}` to understand what makes a great BMAD PRD\n- Internalize the philosophy: information density, traceability, measurable requirements\n- Keep the dual-audience nature (humans + LLMs) in mind\n\n**Then Load the PRD Document:**\n\n- Read `{outputFile}` completely from start to finish\n- Understand the full document structure and content\n- Identify all sections and their relationships\n- Note areas that need attention\n\n### 2. Document Quality Review\n\nReview the entire document with PRD purpose principles in mind:\n\n**Information Density:**\n- Are there wordy phrases that can be condensed?\n- Is conversational padding present?\n- Can sentences be more direct and concise?\n\n**Flow and Coherence:**\n- Do sections transition smoothly?\n- Are there jarring topic shifts?\n- Does the document tell a cohesive story?\n- Is the progression logical for readers?\n\n**Duplication Detection:**\n- Are ideas repeated across sections?\n- Is the same information stated multiple times?\n- Can redundant content be consolidated?\n- Are there contradictory statements?\n\n**Header Structure:**\n- Are all main sections using ## Level 2 headers?\n- Is the hierarchy consistent (##, ###, ####)?\n- Can sections be easily extracted or referenced?\n- Are headers descriptive and clear?\n\n**Readability:**\n- Are sentences clear and concise?\n- Is the language consistent throughout?\n- Are technical terms used appropriately?\n- Would stakeholders find this easy to understand?\n\n### 3. Optimization Actions\n\nMake targeted improvements:\n\n**Improve Flow:**\n- Add transition sentences between sections\n- Smooth out jarring topic shifts\n- Ensure logical progression\n- Connect related concepts across sections\n\n**Reduce Duplication:**\n- Consolidate repeated information\n- Keep content in the most appropriate section\n- Use cross-references instead of repetition\n- Remove redundant explanations\n\n**Enhance Coherence:**\n- Ensure consistent terminology throughout\n- Align all sections with product differentiator\n- Maintain consistent voice and tone\n- Verify scope consistency across sections\n\n**Optimize Headers:**\n- Ensure all main sections use ## Level 2\n- Make headers descriptive and action-oriented\n- Check that headers follow consistent patterns\n- Verify headers support document navigation\n\n### 4. Preserve Critical Information\n\n**While optimizing, ensure NOTHING essential is lost:**\n\n**Must Preserve:**\n- All user success criteria\n- All functional requirements (capability contract)\n- All user journey narratives\n- All scope decisions (MVP, Growth, Vision)\n- All non-functional requirements\n- Product differentiator and vision\n- Domain-specific requirements\n- Innovation analysis (if present)\n\n**Can Consolidate:**\n- Repeated explanations of the same concept\n- Redundant background information\n- Multiple versions of similar content\n- Overlapping examples\n\n### 5. Generate Optimized Document\n\nCreate the polished version:\n\n**Polishing Process:**\n1. Start with original document\n2. Apply all optimization actions\n3. Review to ensure nothing essential was lost\n4. Verify improvements enhance readability\n5. Prepare optimized version for review\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the polished document for review, then display menu:\n- Show what changed in the polish\n- Highlight improvements made (flow, duplication, headers)\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Complete PRD (Step 12 of 12)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with the polished document, process the enhanced refinements that come back, ask user \"Accept these polish improvements? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original polish then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow} with the polished document, process the collaborative refinements to flow and coherence, ask user \"Accept these polish changes? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original polish then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Save the polished document to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', replace the entire document content with the polished version.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Complete document loaded and reviewed\n✅ Flow and coherence improved\n✅ Duplication reduced while preserving essential information\n✅ All main sections use ## Level 2 headers\n✅ Transitions between sections are smooth\n✅ User's voice and intent preserved\n✅ Document is more readable and professional\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Polished document saved when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Loading only partial document (leads to incomplete polish)\n❌ Removing essential information while reducing duplication\n❌ Not preserving user's voice and intent\n❌ Changing content instead of improving presentation\n❌ Not ensuring ## Level 2 headers for main sections\n❌ Making arbitrary style changes instead of coherence improvements\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu for user approval\n❌ Saving polished document without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making changes without complete understanding of document requirements\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and polished document is saved, load `./step-12-complete.md` to complete the workflow.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-12 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and polished document is saved!\n"}}

LLMs consume precise, dense content efficiently.\n\n**Anti-Patterns (Eliminate These):**\n- ❌ \"The system will allow users to...\" → ✅ \"Users can...\"\n- ❌ \"It is important to note that...\" → ✅ State the fact directly\n- ❌ \"In order to...\" → ✅ \"To...\"\n- ❌ Conversational filler and padding → ✅ Direct, concise statements\n\n**Goal:** Maximum information per word. Zero fluff.\n\n---\n\n## The Traceability Chain\n\n**PRD starts the chain:**\n```\nVision → Success Criteria → User Journeys → Functional Requirements → (future: User Stories)\n```\n\n**In the PRD, establish:**\n- Vision → Success Criteria alignment\n- Success Criteria → User Journey coverage\n- User Journey → Functional Requirement mapping\n- All requirements traceable to user needs\n\n**Why:** Each downstream artifact (UX, Architecture, Epics, Stories) must trace back to documented user needs and business objectives. This chain ensures we build the right thing.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Functional Requirements?\n\n### FRs are Capabilities, Not Implementation\n\n**Good FR:** \"Users can reset their password via email link\"\n**Bad FR:** \"System sends JWT via email and validates with database\" (implementation leakage)\n\n**Good FR:** \"Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds for 95th percentile\"\n**Bad FR:** \"Fast loading time\" (subjective, unmeasurable)\n\n### SMART Quality Criteria\n\n**Specific:** Clear, precisely defined capability\n**Measurable:** Quantifiable with test criteria\n**Attainable:** Realistic within constraints\n**Relevant:** Aligns with business objectives\n**Traceable:** Links to source (executive summary or user journey)\n\n### FR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Subjective Adjectives:**\n- ❌ \"easy to use\", \"intuitive\", \"user-friendly\", \"fast\", \"responsive\"\n- ✅ Use metrics: \"completes task in under 3 clicks\", \"loads in under 2 seconds\"\n\n**Implementation Leakage:**\n- ❌ Technology names, specific libraries, implementation details\n- ✅ Focus on capability and measurable outcomes\n\n**Vague Quantifiers:**\n- ❌ \"multiple users\", \"several options\", \"various formats\"\n- ✅ \"up to 100 concurrent users\", \"3-5 options\", \"PDF, DOCX, TXT formats\"\n\n**Missing Test Criteria:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall provide notifications\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall send email notifications within 30 seconds of trigger event\"\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Non-Functional Requirements?\n\n### NFRs Must Be Measurable\n\n**Template:**\n```\n\"The system shall [metric] [condition] [measurement method]\"\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- ✅ \"The system shall respond to API requests in under 200ms for 95th percentile as measured by APM monitoring\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall support 10,000 concurrent users as measured by load testing\"\n\n### NFR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Unmeasurable Claims:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall be scalable\" → ✅ \"The system shall handle 10x load growth through horizontal scaling\"\n- ❌ \"High availability required\" → ✅ \"99.9% uptime as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n\n**Missing Context:**\n- ❌ \"Response time under 1 second\" → ✅ \"API response time under 1 second for 95th percentile under normal load\"\n\n---\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n**Auto-Detect and Enforce Based on Project Context**\n\nCertain industries have mandatory requirements that must be present:\n\n- **Healthcare:** HIPAA Privacy & Security Rules, PHI encryption, audit logging, MFA\n- **Fintech:** PCI-DSS Level 1, AML/KYC compliance, SOX controls, financial audit trails\n- **GovTech:** NIST framework, Section 508 accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), FedRAMP, data residency\n- **E-Commerce:** PCI-DSS for payments, inventory accuracy, tax calculation by jurisdiction\n\n**Why:** Missing these requirements in the PRD means they'll be missed in architecture and implementation, creating expensive rework. During PRD creation there is a step to cover this - during validation we want to make sure it was covered. For this purpose steps will utilize a domain-complexity.csv and project-types.csv.\n\n---\n\n## Document Structure (Markdown, Human-Readable)\n\n### Required Sections\n1. **Executive Summary** - Vision, differentiator, target users\n2. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes (SMART)\n3. **Product Scope** - MVP, Growth, Vision phases\n4. **User Journeys** - Comprehensive coverage\n5. **Domain Requirements** - Industry-specific compliance (if applicable)\n6. **Innovation Analysis** - Competitive differentiation (if applicable)\n7. **Project-Type Requirements** - Platform-specific needs\n8. **Functional Requirements** - Capability contract (FRs)\n9. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Quality attributes (NFRs)\n\n### Formatting for Dual Consumption\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Clear, professional language\n- Logical flow from vision to requirements\n- Easy for stakeholders to review and approve\n\n**For LLMs:**\n- ## Level 2 headers for all main sections (enables extraction)\n- Consistent structure and patterns\n- Precise, testable language\n- High information density\n\n---\n\n## Downstream Impact\n\n**How the PRD Feeds Next Artifacts:**\n\n**UX Design:**\n- User journeys → interaction flows\n- FRs → design requirements\n- Success criteria → UX metrics\n\n**Architecture:**\n- FRs → system capabilities\n- NFRs → architecture decisions\n- Domain requirements → compliance architecture\n- Project-type requirements → platform choices\n\n**Epics & Stories (created after architecture):**\n- FRs → user stories (1 FR could map to 1-3 stories potentially)\n- Acceptance criteria → story acceptance tests\n- Priority → sprint sequencing\n- Traceability → stories map back to vision\n\n**Development AI Agents:**\n- Precise requirements → implementation clarity\n- Test criteria → automated test generation\n- Domain requirements → compliance enforcement\n- Measurable NFRs → performance targets\n\n---\n\n## Summary: What Makes a Great BMAD PRD?\n\n✅ **High Information Density** - Every sentence carries weight, zero fluff\n✅ **Measurable Requirements** - All FRs and NFRs are testable with specific criteria\n✅ **Clear Traceability** - Each requirement links to user need and business objective\n✅ **Domain Awareness** - Industry-specific requirements auto-detected and included\n✅ **Zero Anti-Patterns** - No subjective adjectives, implementation leakage, or vague quantifiers\n✅ **Dual Audience Optimized** - Human-readable AND LLM-consumable\n✅ **Markdown Format** - Professional, clean, accessible to all stakeholders\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** The PRD is the foundation. Quality here ripples through every subsequent phase. A dense, precise, well-traced PRD makes UX design, architecture, epic breakdown, and AI development dramatically more effective.\n"}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Success looks like:\n- New services/features fit cleanly into the baseline without redesign.\n- Developers hit constraints early and think “good—this would’ve been messy later.”\n- The trust contract is treated as the default, not a suggestion.\nSecondary signals:\n- Dangerous operations are surfaced explicitly instead of silently allowed.\n- New engineers can learn tenancy from code, not Slack history.\n\n### Business Success\n\n**~3 months (validation):**\n- Integrated into multiple real (non-demo) projects.\n- Some integrations happen at project start, not as refactors.\n- Users keep it after initial experimentation.\n- Feedback references it as a “baseline,” “foundation,” or “we didn’t have to reinvent this.”\n- Early adopters cite it in internal docs or architectural notes.\nSuccess test: the right users take it seriously and keep it.\n\n**~12 months (traction):**\n- Repeat usage by the same teams across multiple projects.\n- Low churn despite intentionally narrow scope.\n- Mentions in engineering blogs, architecture discussions, or internal platform standards.\n- Pull-through demand for examples/extensions/integrations (not feature bloat).\n- Teams describe it as infrastructure they wouldn’t remove without concern.\nSuccess test: it’s treated as infrastructure, not a trial tool.\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Core invariants are enforced through unavoidable integration points.\n- Ambiguous or un-attributed operations are refused by default.\n- Contract/verification tests exist, are runnable by adopters, and are executed in CI.\n- The core API surface stays small, stable, and resists ad-hoc extension.\n- Behavior is consistent across request paths, background execution, and admin/scripted usage.\nTechnical success = guarantees hold even as usage patterns expand.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Multiple real projects integrate TenantSaas, with at least some greenfield starts.\n- Retention after initial experimentation (kept in place).\n- Documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- Contract tests running in CI across adopters.\n- Repeat adoption across projects by the same teams.\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Explicit baseline model for multi-tenant SaaS.\n- One or more enforced invariants that remove ambiguity early.\n- A single unavoidable integration point anchoring the baseline.\n- Verification mechanism (tests/assertions) that proves rules hold.\n- Documentation that explains the model and contract (not features).\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Optional extensions/adapters.\n- Reference implementations or example apps.\n- Additional verification/reporting hooks.\n- Integration patterns for common tooling.\n- Better ergonomics around configuration and visibility.\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Recognized baseline for serious multi-tenant systems.\n- Core remains small and conservative.\n- Innovation primarily in extensions/examples/ecosystem contributions.\n- Shapes how teams think about SaaS foundations, not just scaffolding.\n- Referenced as a trust kernel, not marketed as a framework.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### 1) Platform engineer integrating TenantSaas into a new service\n\n**Opening scene:** Maya owns platform standards and is starting a new service in a growing SaaS stack. She is wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.\n**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.\n**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution. It forces a decision at design time, not after launch.\n**Resolution:** Maya adopts the trust contract as a shared team standard. The new service fits into existing architecture without special cases, and future services reuse the same baseline without re-debate.\n\n### 2) On-call responder using elevated scope during an incident (edge case)\n\n**Opening scene:** Jordan is on call when a cross-tenant data correction is required under time pressure.\n**Rising action:** Jordan attempts a privileged operation; the system requires explicit scope elevation with clear intent, not silent admin access.\n**Climax:** The system allows the operation only through a constrained path that is visible and auditable, avoiding accidental overreach.\n**Resolution:** The fix is applied quickly without bypassing the baseline. The incident is resolved and the audit trail is clean, with no special exceptions introduced.\n\n### 3) Founder / early builder adopting at project start\n\n**Opening scene:** Priya is starting a new SaaS product and wants to avoid fixing multi-tenancy later.\n**Rising action:** She adds TenantSaas early because it is small, explicit, and does not prescribe a full framework.\n**Climax:** The baseline forces clarity around tenant context at the first integration point, and Priya realizes she does not need to invent her own conventions.\n**Resolution:** The team moves fast with confidence, knowing the core assumptions are locked in without slowing momentum.\n\n### 4) Security/compliance stakeholder reviewing guarantees\n\n**Opening scene:** Alex is asked to assess tenant isolation guarantees before an external review.\n**Rising action:** Alex inspects the trust contract and verification artifacts rather than chasing tribal knowledge.\n**Climax:** The evidence shows invariants enforced at unavoidable choke points, with contract tests that can be executed in CI.\n**Resolution:** Alex can approve the baseline as a credible control, because the guarantees are explicit and verifiable, not implied.\n\n### 5) API/integration contributor extending or adapting the core\n\n**Opening scene:** Sam wants to create an adapter for a different stack while keeping the core intact.\n**Rising action:** Sam reviews the constraints and sees where extensions are allowed versus where invariants are non-negotiable.\n**Climax:** The adapter integrates through the sanctioned boundary and inherits the same guarantees without widening the core API.\n**Resolution:** The extension adds reach without fragmenting the baseline, and the core remains intentionally small.\n\n### 6) New engineer onboarding into an existing system (acceptance signal)\n\n**Opening scene:** Riley joins an existing team mid-project.\n**Rising action:** Riley reads the baseline code and its contract tests rather than relying on oral history.\n**Climax:** A constrained operation makes the rules explicit, and the correct pattern is discoverable in code.\n**Resolution:** Onboarding requires fewer explanations, which acts as an acceptance signal that the baseline is doing its job.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- A single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context.\n- Explicit tenant attribution required before operations proceed.\n- Controlled, auditable elevation paths for privileged actions.\n- A clear, inspectable trust contract with runnable verification tests.\n- An extension model that preserves invariants and keeps the core small.\n- Baseline conventions are discoverable in code, not tribal knowledge.\n\n## Developer Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTenantSaas is a developer-facing foundation package for .NET-first multi-tenant systems, with a secondary npm distribution. It is embedded into existing systems as a baseline, not a standalone product.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- The core package must be minimal, invariant-driven, and safe by default.\n- A single, unavoidable integration point anchors tenant context for request paths and background execution.\n- Verification artifacts (contract tests) are part of the core deliverable and runnable by adopters.\n\n### Language Support (Language Matrix)\n\n- **MVP support:** .NET\n- **Secondary distribution:** npm package (for complementary tooling or examples)\n- **Out of scope for MVP:** other runtimes/languages\n\n### Installation Methods\n\n- **NuGet** as the primary installation path.\n- **npm** for any supporting tooling or integration snippets.\n- No IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n\n### API Surface\n\n- Small, stable API surface focused on tenant context, invariants, and verification hooks.\n- Avoid extension points that bypass invariants or widen core behavior.\n- Explicit refusal paths for ambiguous attribution or privileged actions.\n\n### Documentation & Guides (Required for MVP)\n\n- Concise conceptual model.\n- Explicit trust contract.\n- Minimal integration guide.\n- Runnable verification/contract tests guide.\n- Small API reference (focused on the core surface only).\n\n### Code Examples\n\n- One minimal sample project.\n- Copy-paste integration snippets.\n- No full reference application for MVP.\n\n### Migration Guide\n\n- MVP: no migration guide required (greenfield-first baseline).\n- Future: add a migration guide if adopting into existing systems becomes a primary use case.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Baseline must be hard to remove once integrated, without adding operational friction.\n- Contract tests should be easily wired into CI with minimal configuration.\n- Keep documentation crisp and enforce the mental model over feature descriptions.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Problem-solving MVP (prove guarantees are real and usable), with platform discipline for extensibility.\n**Resource Requirements:** 1 person with strong backend/systems thinking, multi-tenant architecture expertise, API/contract design, test rigor, and clear technical writing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Platform engineer integrating into a new service\n- Founder/early builder starting a project\n- Security/compliance reviewer inspecting guarantees\n- Contributor reading/extending the core (design-level)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Explicit baseline model (tenancy, shared system, scope)\n- One unavoidable integration point\n- Enforced invariants (small, non-negotiable)\n- Verification mechanism (contract tests or equivalent)\n- Clear non-goals and refusal behavior\n- Minimal sample + integration snippets\n- Conceptual + contract documentation\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- On-call incident workflows (documented, not deeply supported)\n- New-hire onboarding narratives\n- Advanced ops/support tooling\n- Additional adapters or helpers\n- Observability hooks\n- More ergonomic APIs\n- Extended examples (jobs, reporting, admin)\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Reference app\n- Ecosystem packages and optional extensions\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Guarantees too weak to matter or too rigid to use. Mitigate by keeping invariants minimal, validating in at least one real integration, and treating escape hatches as design failures unless explicitly justified.\n**Market Risks:** Misinterpreted as just another library or too abstract. Mitigate by leading with problem framing, stating non-goals clearly, and anchoring messaging on baseline/foundation rather than productivity.\n**Resource Risks:** Over-engineering and drifting into framework territory. Mitigate by freezing scope, requiring a new invariant for any new capability, and deleting ideas rather than deferring them.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Tenant Context & Baseline Model\n\n- FR1: Platform engineers can define the canonical tenant identity model used across the system.\n- FR2: The system can represent tenant scope and shared-system scope as explicit, distinct contexts.\n- FR3: The system can represent a no-tenant state only when explicitly justified by the trust contract.\n- FR4: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.\n- FR5: The baseline model can be referenced as a single source of truth by services integrating it.\n\n### Invariant Enforcement & Refusal Behavior\n\n- FR6: The system can refuse operations with ambiguous or missing tenant attribution.\n- FR7: The system can enforce a small, non-negotiable invariant set defined by the trust contract.\n- FR8: Invariant enforcement applies uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths.\n- FR9: The system can surface refusal reasons explicitly to developers when invariants are violated.\n- FR10: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent and cannot proceed silently.\n\n### Integration Point & Context Propagation\n\n- FR11: The system provides a single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context initialization.\n- FR12: The integration point can propagate tenant context to downstream operations consistently.\n- FR13: The integration point can reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent.\n- FR14: Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold.\n\n### Verification & Contract Tests\n\n- FR15: The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement.\n- FR16: Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence.\n- FR17: Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package.\n- FR18: Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts.\n\n### Documentation & Trust Contract\n\n- FR19: The system provides a concise conceptual model describing tenancy, scope, and shared-system context.\n- FR20: The system provides an explicit trust contract that defines invariants and refusal behavior.\n- FR21: The system provides a minimal integration guide that shows the single integration point and required steps.\n- FR22: The system provides a verification guide that explains how to run and interpret contract tests.\n- FR23: The system provides a small API reference limited to the core surface area.\n\n### Extensibility & Adapter Boundaries\n\n- FR24: The system defines explicit boundaries where extensions may be built without weakening invariants.\n- FR25: Adapters can integrate through sanctioned boundaries while preserving the trust contract.\n- FR26: The core surface resists ad-hoc extension paths that would bypass enforcement.\n\n### Developer Onboarding & Discoverability (Acceptance Signals Only)\n\n- FR27: New engineers can discover the baseline rules from code and verification artifacts without tribal knowledge.\n- FR28: The baseline’s refusal behavior makes correct patterns discoverable through normal development flow.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Security\n\n- The system refuses ambiguous or un-attributed operations by default.\n- Privileged or cross-scope actions require explicit declaration and justification.\n- No silent fallback behavior is permitted when required context is missing.\n- Security-relevant behavior is inspectable via code and tests, not configuration alone.\n\n### Reliability\n\n- Invariant enforcement behaves deterministically across execution paths.\n- Failure modes are explicit, local, and actionable (no partial success).\n- The system fails fast rather than degrading into unsafe behavior.\n- Core guarantees do not depend on runtime ordering, timing, or environment quirks.\n\n### Integration\n\n- The baseline integrates through a small, well-defined, unavoidable entry point.\n- Integration does not require adopting a framework, hosting model, or domain structure.\n- Integration is possible without modifying application business logic.\n- Removal or bypass of the integration point is detectable.\n\n### Performance\n\n- The core introduces no unbounded runtime overhead.\n- Enforcement checks are constant-time relative to request or operation scope.\n- No background polling, global locks, or centralized runtime dependencies are allowed.\n\n### Scalability\n\n- Guarantees hold regardless of application size or number of tenants.\n- The model does not assume a single service, database, or deployment topology.\n- Scaling does not require weakening or disabling core invariants.\n\n### Accessibility\n\n- Not applicable. TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Suggest Next Workflows\n\nProvide guidance on logical next workflows - strongly suggesting any of these chosen are started in a fresh context with the appropriate agent:\n\n**Typical Next Workflows:**\n\n**Immediate Next Steps:**\n\n1. **PRD Quality Validation First (Recommended):**\n   - execute the `{validationFlow}` workflow if selected or start a new chat with me and select the validate PRD menu item\n   - Ensures PRD is complete and ready\n   - Identifies any gaps or issues\n   - Validates before committing to architecture/design\n\n2. **UX Design:** `workflow create-ux-design` with the UX-Designer Agent (if UI exists)\n   - User journey insights from step-04 inform interaction design\n   - Functional requirements from step-09 define design scope\n   - Polish-optimized document provides clear design requirements\n\n3. **Technical Architecture:** `workflow create-architecture` with the Architect Agent\n   - Project-type requirements from step-07 guide technical decisions\n   - Non-functional requirements from step-10 inform architecture choices\n   - Functional requirements define system capabilities\n\n4. **Epic Breakdown:** `workflow create-epics-and-stories` with me again - but really recommend first doing a UX if needed and an architecture!\n   - Functional requirements from step-09 become epics and stories\n   - Scope definition from step-03 guides sprint planning\n   - Richer when created after UX/architecture\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n- Validation adds confidence before architecture/design investment\n- UX design and architecture can happen in parallel after validation\n- Epics/stories are richer when created after UX/architecture\n- Order depends on team preferences and project needs\n\n### 5. Final Completion Confirmation\n\n- Confirm completion with user and summarize what has been accomplished\n- Document now contains: Executive Summary, Success Criteria, User Journeys, Domain Requirements (if applicable), Innovation Analysis (if applicable), Project-Type Requirements, Functional Requirements (capability contract), Non-Functional Requirements, and has been polished for flow and coherence\n- Ask if they'd like to run validation workflow or proceed to next workflows\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ PRD document contains all required sections and has been polished\n✅ All collaborative content properly saved and optimized\n✅ Workflow status file updated with completion information (if exists)\n✅ Validation workflow options clearly presented\n✅ Clear next step guidance provided to user\n✅ Document quality validation completed\n✅ User acknowledges completion and understands next options\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not updating workflow status file with completion information (if exists)\n❌ Not offering validation workflow options\n❌ Missing clear next step guidance for user\n❌ Not confirming document completeness with user\n❌ Workflow not properly marked as complete in status tracking (if applicable)\n❌ User unclear about what happens next or what validation options exist\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## WORKFLOW COMPLETION CHECKLIST:\n\n### Document Structure Complete:\n\n- [ ] Executive Summary with vision and differentiator\n- [ ] Success Criteria with measurable outcomes\n- [ ] Product Scope (MVP, Growth, Vision)\n- [ ] User Journeys (comprehensive coverage)\n- [ ] Domain Requirements (if applicable)\n- [ ] Innovation Analysis (if applicable)\n- [ ] Project-Type Requirements\n- [ ] Functional Requirements (capability contract)\n- [ ] Non-Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Document polished for flow and coherence\n\n### Process Complete:\n\n- [ ] All steps (including polish) completed with user confirmation\n- [ ] All content saved and optimized\n- [ ] Frontmatter properly updated\n- [ ] Workflow status file updated (if exists)\n- [ ] Validation options presented\n- [ ] Next steps clearly communicated\n\n## FINAL REMINDER to give the user:\n\nThe polished PRD serves as the foundation for all subsequent product development activities. All design, architecture, and development work should trace back to the requirements and vision documented in this PRD - update it also as needed as you continue planning.\n\n**Congratulations on completing the Product Requirements Document for {{project_name}}!** 🎉\n"}}
