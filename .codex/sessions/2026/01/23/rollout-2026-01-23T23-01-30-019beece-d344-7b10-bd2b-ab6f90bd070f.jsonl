You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Mode Determination\n\n**Check if mode was specified in the command invocation:**\n\n- If user invoked with \"create prd\" or \"new prd\" or \"build prd\" or \"-c\" or \"--create\" → Set mode to **create**\n- If user invoked with \"validate prd\" or \"review prd\" or \"check prd\" or \"-v\" or \"--validate\" → Set mode to **validate**\n- If user invoked with \"edit prd\" or \"modify prd\" or \"improve prd\" or \"-e\" or \"--edit\" → Set mode to **edit**\n\n**If mode is still unclear, ask user:**\n\n\"**PRD Workflow - Select Mode:**\n\n**[C] Create** - Create a new PRD from scratch\n**[V] Validate** - Validate an existing PRD against BMAD standards\n**[E] Edit** - Improve an existing PRD\n\nWhich mode would you like?\"\n\nWait for user selection.\n\n### 2. Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {main_config} and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`\n- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`\n- `date` as system-generated current datetime\n\n✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the configured `{communication_language}`.\n\n### 3. Route to Appropriate Workflow\n\n**IF mode == create:**\n\"**Create Mode: Creating a new PRD from scratch.**\"\nLoad, read entire file, then execute `{nextStep}` (steps-c/step-01-init.md)\n\n**IF mode == validate:**\n\"**Validate Mode: Validating an existing PRD against BMAD standards.**\"\nPrompt for PRD path: \"Which PRD would you like to validate?

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Load PRD Purpose and Standards\n\nLoad and read the complete file at:\n`{prdPurpose}`\n\nThis file contains the BMAD PRD philosophy, standards, and validation criteria that will guide all validation checks. Internalize this understanding - it defines what makes a great BMAD PRD.\n\n### 2. Discover PRD to Validate\n\n**If PRD path provided as invocation parameter:**\n- Use provided path\n\n**If no PRD path provided:**\n\"**PRD Validation Workflow**\n\nWhich PRD would you like to validate?\n\nPlease provide the path to the PRD file you want to validate.\"\n\n**Wait for user to provide PRD path.**\n\n### 3. Validate PRD Exists and Load\n\nOnce PRD path is provided:\n\n- Check if PRD file exists at specified path\n- If not found: \"I cannot find a PRD at that path. Please check the path and try again.\"\n- If found: Load the complete PRD file including frontmatter\n\n### 4. Extract Frontmatter and Input Documents\n\nFrom the loaded PRD frontmatter, extract:\n\n- `inputDocuments: []` array (if present)\n- Any other relevant metadata (classification, date, etc.)\n\n**If no inputDocuments array exists:**\nNote this and proceed with PRD-only validation\n\n### 5. Load Input Documents\n\nFor each document listed in `inputDocuments`:\n\n- Attempt to load the document\n- Track successfully loaded documents\n- Note any documents that fail to load\n\n**Build list of loaded input documents:**\n- Product Brief (if present)\n- Research documents (if present)\n- Other reference materials (if present)\n\n### 6. Ask About Additional Reference Documents\n\n\"**I've loaded the following documents from your PRD frontmatter:**\n\n{list loaded documents with file names}\n\n**Are there any additional reference documents you'd like me to include in this validation?**\n\nThese could include:\n- Additional research or context documents\n- Project documentation not tracked in frontmatter\n- Standards or compliance documents\n- Competitive analysis or benchmarks\n\nPlease provide paths to any additional documents, or type 'none' to proceed.\"\n\n**Load any additional documents provided by user.**\n\n### 7. Initialize Validation Report\n\nCreate validation report at: `{validationReportPath}`\n\n**Initialize with frontmatter:**\n```yaml\n---\nvalidationTarget: '{prd_path}'\nvalidationDate: '{current_date}'\ninputDocuments: [list of all loaded documents]\nvalidationStepsCompleted: []\nvalidationStatus: IN_PROGRESS\n---\n```\n\n**Initial content:**\n```markdown\n# PRD Validation Report\n\n**PRD Being Validated:** {prd_path}\n**Validation Date:** {current_date}\n\n## Input Documents\n\n{list all documents loaded for validation}\n\n## Validation Findings\n\n[Findings will be appended as validation progresses]\n```\n\n### 8. Present Discovery Summary\n\n\"**Setup Complete!**\n\n**PRD to Validate:** {prd_path}\n\n**Input Documents Loaded:**\n- PRD: {prd_name} ✓\n- Product Brief: {count} {if count > 0}✓{else}(none found){/if}\n- Research: {count} {if count > 0}✓{else}(none found){/if}\n- Additional References: {count} {if count > 0}✓{else}(none){/if}\n\n**Validation Report:** {validationReportPath}\n\n**Ready to begin validation.**\"\n\n### 9. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: **Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Format Detection\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- User can ask questions or add more documents - always respond and redisplay menu\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask}, and when finished redisplay the menu\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow}, and when finished redisplay the menu\n- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile} to begin format detection\n- IF user provides additional document: Load it, update report, redisplay summary\n- IF Any other: help user, then redisplay menu\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- PRD path discovered and confirmed\n- PRD file exists and loads successfully\n- All input documents from frontmatter loaded\n- Additional reference documents (if any) loaded\n- Validation report initialized next to PRD\n- User clearly informed of setup status\n- Menu presented and user input handled correctly\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Proceeding with non-existent PRD file\n- Not loading input documents from frontmatter\n- Creating validation report in wrong location\n- Proceeding without user confirming setup\n- Not handling missing input documents gracefully\n\n**Master Rule:** Complete discovery and setup BEFORE validation. This step ensures everything is in place for systematic validation checks.\n"}}

LLMs consume precise, dense content efficiently.\n\n**Anti-Patterns (Eliminate These):**\n- ❌ \"The system will allow users to...\" → ✅ \"Users can...\"\n- ❌ \"It is important to note that...\" → ✅ State the fact directly\n- ❌ \"In order to...\" → ✅ \"To...\"\n- ❌ Conversational filler and padding → ✅ Direct, concise statements\n\n**Goal:** Maximum information per word. Zero fluff.\n\n---\n\n## The Traceability Chain\n\n**PRD starts the chain:**\n```\nVision → Success Criteria → User Journeys → Functional Requirements → (future: User Stories)\n```\n\n**In the PRD, establish:**\n- Vision → Success Criteria alignment\n- Success Criteria → User Journey coverage\n- User Journey → Functional Requirement mapping\n- All requirements traceable to user needs\n\n**Why:** Each downstream artifact (UX, Architecture, Epics, Stories) must trace back to documented user needs and business objectives. This chain ensures we build the right thing.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Functional Requirements?\n\n### FRs are Capabilities, Not Implementation\n\n**Good FR:** \"Users can reset their password via email link\"\n**Bad FR:** \"System sends JWT via email and validates with database\" (implementation leakage)\n\n**Good FR:** \"Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds for 95th percentile\"\n**Bad FR:** \"Fast loading time\" (subjective, unmeasurable)\n\n### SMART Quality Criteria\n\n**Specific:** Clear, precisely defined capability\n**Measurable:** Quantifiable with test criteria\n**Attainable:** Realistic within constraints\n**Relevant:** Aligns with business objectives\n**Traceable:** Links to source (executive summary or user journey)\n\n### FR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Subjective Adjectives:**\n- ❌ \"easy to use\", \"intuitive\", \"user-friendly\", \"fast\", \"responsive\"\n- ✅ Use metrics: \"completes task in under 3 clicks\", \"loads in under 2 seconds\"\n\n**Implementation Leakage:**\n- ❌ Technology names, specific libraries, implementation details\n- ✅ Focus on capability and measurable outcomes\n\n**Vague Quantifiers:**\n- ❌ \"multiple users\", \"several options\", \"various formats\"\n- ✅ \"up to 100 concurrent users\", \"3-5 options\", \"PDF, DOCX, TXT formats\"\n\n**Missing Test Criteria:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall provide notifications\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall send email notifications within 30 seconds of trigger event\"\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Non-Functional Requirements?\n\n### NFRs Must Be Measurable\n\n**Template:**\n```\n\"The system shall [metric] [condition] [measurement method]\"\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- ✅ \"The system shall respond to API requests in under 200ms for 95th percentile as measured by APM monitoring\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall support 10,000 concurrent users as measured by load testing\"\n\n### NFR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Unmeasurable Claims:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall be scalable\" → ✅ \"The system shall handle 10x load growth through horizontal scaling\"\n- ❌ \"High availability required\" → ✅ \"99.9% uptime as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n\n**Missing Context:**\n- ❌ \"Response time under 1 second\" → ✅ \"API response time under 1 second for 95th percentile under normal load\"\n\n---\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n**Auto-Detect and Enforce Based on Project Context**\n\nCertain industries have mandatory requirements that must be present:\n\n- **Healthcare:** HIPAA Privacy & Security Rules, PHI encryption, audit logging, MFA\n- **Fintech:** PCI-DSS Level 1, AML/KYC compliance, SOX controls, financial audit trails\n- **GovTech:** NIST framework, Section 508 accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), FedRAMP, data residency\n- **E-Commerce:** PCI-DSS for payments, inventory accuracy, tax calculation by jurisdiction\n\n**Why:** Missing these requirements in the PRD means they'll be missed in architecture and implementation, creating expensive rework. During PRD creation there is a step to cover this - during validation we want to make sure it was covered. For this purpose steps will utilize a domain-complexity.csv and project-types.csv.\n\n---\n\n## Document Structure (Markdown, Human-Readable)\n\n### Required Sections\n1. **Executive Summary** - Vision, differentiator, target users\n2. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes (SMART)\n3. **Product Scope** - MVP, Growth, Vision phases\n4. **User Journeys** - Comprehensive coverage\n5. **Domain Requirements** - Industry-specific compliance (if applicable)\n6. **Innovation Analysis** - Competitive differentiation (if applicable)\n7. **Project-Type Requirements** - Platform-specific needs\n8. **Functional Requirements** - Capability contract (FRs)\n9. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Quality attributes (NFRs)\n\n### Formatting for Dual Consumption\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Clear, professional language\n- Logical flow from vision to requirements\n- Easy for stakeholders to review and approve\n\n**For LLMs:**\n- ## Level 2 headers for all main sections (enables extraction)\n- Consistent structure and patterns\n- Precise, testable language\n- High information density\n\n---\n\n## Downstream Impact\n\n**How the PRD Feeds Next Artifacts:**\n\n**UX Design:**\n- User journeys → interaction flows\n- FRs → design requirements\n- Success criteria → UX metrics\n\n**Architecture:**\n- FRs → system capabilities\n- NFRs → architecture decisions\n- Domain requirements → compliance architecture\n- Project-type requirements → platform choices\n\n**Epics & Stories (created after architecture):**\n- FRs → user stories (1 FR could map to 1-3 stories potentially)\n- Acceptance criteria → story acceptance tests\n- Priority → sprint sequencing\n- Traceability → stories map back to vision\n\n**Development AI Agents:**\n- Precise requirements → implementation clarity\n- Test criteria → automated test generation\n- Domain requirements → compliance enforcement\n- Measurable NFRs → performance targets\n\n---\n\n## Summary: What Makes a Great BMAD PRD?\n\n✅ **High Information Density** - Every sentence carries weight, zero fluff\n✅ **Measurable Requirements** - All FRs and NFRs are testable with specific criteria\n✅ **Clear Traceability** - Each requirement links to user need and business objective\n✅ **Domain Awareness** - Industry-specific requirements auto-detected and included\n✅ **Zero Anti-Patterns** - No subjective adjectives, implementation leakage, or vague quantifiers\n✅ **Dual Audience Optimized** - Human-readable AND LLM-consumable\n✅ **Markdown Format** - Professional, clean, accessible to all stakeholders\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** The PRD is the foundation. Quality here ripples through every subsequent phase. A dense, precise, well-traced PRD makes UX design, architecture, epic breakdown, and AI development dramatically more effective.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

She is wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.\n**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.\n**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution. It forces a decision at design time, not after launch.\n**Resolution:** Maya adopts the trust contract as a shared team standard. The new service fits into existing architecture without special cases, and future services reuse the same baseline without re-debate.\n\n### 2) On-call responder using elevated scope during an incident (edge case)\n\n**Opening scene:** Jordan is on call when a cross-tenant data correction is required under time pressure.\n**Rising action:** Jordan attempts a privileged operation; the system requires explicit scope elevation with clear intent, not silent admin access.\n**Climax:** The system allows the operation only through a constrained path that is visible and auditable, avoiding accidental overreach.\n**Resolution:** The fix is applied quickly without bypassing the baseline. The incident is resolved and the audit trail is clean, with no special exceptions introduced.\n\n### 3) Founder / early builder adopting at project start\n\n**Opening scene:** Priya is starting a new SaaS product and wants to avoid fixing multi-tenancy later.\n**Rising action:** She adds TenantSaas early because it is small, explicit, and does not prescribe a full framework.\n**Climax:** The baseline forces clarity around tenant context at the first integration point, and Priya realizes she does not need to invent her own conventions.\n**Resolution:** The team moves fast with confidence, knowing the core assumptions are locked in without slowing momentum.\n\n### 4) Security/compliance stakeholder reviewing guarantees\n\n**Opening scene:** Alex is asked to assess tenant isolation guarantees before an external review.\n**Rising action:** Alex inspects the trust contract and verification artifacts rather than chasing tribal knowledge.\n**Climax:** The evidence shows invariants enforced at unavoidable choke points, with contract tests that can be executed in CI.\n**Resolution:** Alex can approve the baseline as a credible control, because the guarantees are explicit and verifiable, not implied.\n\n### 5) API/integration contributor extending or adapting the core\n\n**Opening scene:** Sam wants to create an adapter for a different stack while keeping the core intact.\n**Rising action:** Sam reviews the constraints and sees where extensions are allowed versus where invariants are non-negotiable.\n**Climax:** The adapter integrates through the sanctioned boundary and inherits the same guarantees without widening the core API.\n**Resolution:** The extension adds reach without fragmenting the baseline, and the core remains intentionally small.\n\n### 6) New engineer onboarding into an existing system (acceptance signal)\n\n**Opening scene:** Riley joins an existing team mid-project.\n**Rising action:** Riley reads the baseline code and its contract tests rather than relying on oral history.\n**Climax:** A constrained operation makes the rules explicit, and the correct pattern is discoverable in code.\n**Resolution:** Onboarding requires fewer explanations, which acts as an acceptance signal that the baseline is doing its job.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- A single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context.\n- Explicit tenant attribution required before operations proceed.\n- Controlled, auditable elevation paths for privileged actions.\n- A clear, inspectable trust contract with runnable verification tests.\n- An extension model that preserves invariants and keeps the core small.\n- Baseline conventions are discoverable in code, not tribal knowledge.\n\n## Developer Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTenantSaas is a developer-facing foundation package for .NET-first multi-tenant systems, with a secondary npm distribution. It is embedded into existing systems as a baseline, not a standalone product.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- The core package must be minimal, invariant-driven, and safe by default.\n- A single, unavoidable integration point anchors tenant context for request paths and background execution.\n- Verification artifacts (contract tests) are part of the core deliverable and runnable by adopters.\n\n### Language Support (Language Matrix)\n\n- **MVP support:** .NET\n- **Secondary distribution:** npm package (for complementary tooling or examples)\n- **Out of scope for MVP:** other runtimes/languages\n\n### Installation Methods\n\n- **NuGet** as the primary installation path.\n- **npm** for any supporting tooling or integration snippets.\n- No IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n\n### API Surface\n\n- Small, stable API surface focused on tenant context, invariants, and verification hooks.\n- Avoid extension points that bypass invariants or widen core behavior.\n- Explicit refusal paths for ambiguous attribution or privileged actions.\n\n### Documentation & Guides (Required for MVP)\n\n- Concise conceptual model.\n- Explicit trust contract.\n- Minimal integration guide.\n- Runnable verification/contract tests guide.\n- Small API reference (focused on the core surface only).\n\n### Code Examples\n\n- One minimal sample project.\n- Copy-paste integration snippets.\n- No full reference application for MVP.\n\n### Migration Guide\n\n- MVP: no migration guide required (greenfield-first baseline).\n- Future: add a migration guide if adopting into existing systems becomes a primary use case.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Baseline must be hard to remove once integrated, without adding operational friction.\n- Contract tests should be easily wired into CI with minimal configuration.\n- Keep documentation crisp and enforce the mental model over feature descriptions.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Problem-solving MVP (prove guarantees are real and usable), with platform discipline for extensibility.\n**Resource Requirements:** 1 person with strong backend/systems thinking, multi-tenant architecture expertise, API/contract design, test rigor, and clear technical writing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Platform engineer integrating into a new service\n- Founder/early builder starting a project\n- Security/compliance reviewer inspecting guarantees\n- Contributor reading/extending the core (design-level)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Explicit baseline model (tenancy, shared system, scope)\n- One unavoidable integration point\n- Enforced invariants (small, non-negotiable)\n- Verification mechanism (contract tests or equivalent)\n- Clear non-goals and refusal behavior\n- Minimal sample + integration snippets\n- Conceptual + contract documentation\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- On-call incident workflows (documented, not deeply supported)\n- New-hire onboarding narratives\n- Advanced ops/support tooling\n- Additional adapters or helpers\n- Observability hooks\n- More ergonomic APIs\n- Extended examples (jobs, reporting, admin)\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Reference app\n- Ecosystem packages and optional extensions\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Guarantees too weak to matter or too rigid to use. Mitigate by keeping invariants minimal, validating in at least one real integration, and treating escape hatches as design failures unless explicitly justified.\n**Market Risks:** Misinterpreted as just another library or too abstract. Mitigate by leading with problem framing, stating non-goals clearly, and anchoring messaging on baseline/foundation rather than productivity.\n**Resource Risks:** Over-engineering and drifting into framework territory. Mitigate by freezing scope, requiring a new invariant for any new capability, and deleting ideas rather than deferring them.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Tenant Context & Baseline Model\n\n- FR1: Platform engineers can define the canonical tenant identity model used across the system.\n- FR2: The system can represent tenant scope and shared-system scope as explicit, distinct contexts.\n- FR3: The system can represent a no tenant state only when explicitly justified by the trust contract.\n- FR4: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.\n- FR5: The baseline model can be referenced as a single source of truth by services integrating it.\n\n### Invariant Enforcement & Refusal Behavior\n\n- FR6: The system can refuse operations with ambiguous or missing tenant attribution.\n- FR7: The system can enforce a small, non-negotiable invariant set defined by the trust contract.\n- FR8: Invariant enforcement applies uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths.\n- FR9: The system can surface refusal reasons explicitly to developers when invariants are violated.\n- FR10: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent and cannot proceed silently.\n\n### Integration Point & Context Propagation\n\n- FR11: The system provides a single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context initialization.\n- FR12: The integration point can propagate tenant context to downstream operations consistently.\n- FR13: The integration point can reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent.\n- FR14: Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold.\n\n### Verification & Contract Tests\n\n- FR15: The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement.\n- FR16: Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence.\n- FR17: Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package.\n- FR18: Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts.\n\n### Documentation & Trust Contract\n\n- FR19: The system provides a concise conceptual model describing tenancy, scope, and shared-system context.\n- FR20: The system provides an explicit trust contract that defines invariants and refusal behavior.\n- FR21: The system provides a minimal integration guide that shows the single integration point and required steps.\n- FR22: The system provides a verification guide that explains how to run and interpret contract tests.\n- FR23: The system provides a small API reference limited to the core surface area.\n\n### Extensibility & Adapter Boundaries\n\n- FR24: The system defines explicit boundaries where extensions may be built without weakening invariants.\n- FR25: Adapters can integrate through sanctioned boundaries while preserving the trust contract.\n- FR26: The core surface resists ad-hoc extension paths that would bypass enforcement.\n\n### Developer Onboarding & Discoverability (Acceptance Signals Only)\n\n- FR27: New engineers can discover the baseline rules from code and verification artifacts without tribal knowledge.\n- FR28: The baseline’s refusal behavior makes correct patterns discoverable through normal development flow.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Security\n\n- The system refuses ambiguous or unattributed operations by default.\n- Privileged or cross-scope actions require explicit declaration and justification.\n- No silent fallback behavior is permitted when required context is missing.\n- Security-relevant behavior is inspectable via code and tests, not configuration alone.\n\n### Reliability\n\n- Invariant enforcement behaves deterministically across execution paths.\n- Failure modes are explicit, local, and actionable (no partial success).\n- The system fails fast rather than degrading into unsafe behavior.\n- Core guarantees do not depend on runtime ordering, timing, or environment quirks.\n\n### Integration\n\n- The baseline integrates through a small, well-defined, unavoidable entry point.\n- Integration does not require adopting a framework, hosting model, or domain structure.\n- Integration is possible without modifying application business logic.\n- Removal or bypass of the integration point is detectable.\n\n### Performance\n\n- The core introduces no unbounded runtime overhead.\n- Enforcement checks are constant-time relative to request or operation scope.\n- No background polling, global locks, or centralized runtime dependencies are allowed.\n\n### Scalability\n\n- Guarantees hold regardless of application size or number of tenants.\n- The model does not assume a single service, database, or deployment topology.\n- Scaling does not require weakening or disabling core invariants.\n\n### Accessibility\n\n- Not applicable. TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.\n"}}

It addresses a systemic safety problem: teams routinely perform shared-system actions with ambiguous ownership, scope, or authority, which leads to irreversible trust failures. The product encodes trust as explicit invariants, enforced at unavoidable choke points, so unsafe actions fail immediately and clearly. The goal is to make it hard to build multi-tenant systems incorrectly-and impossible to do so quietly.\n\n---\n\n## Core Vision\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nMulti-tenant SaaS systems regularly allow actions whose tenant ownership, scope, or authority is implicit or ambiguous. This ambiguity produces latent, catastrophic failures-cross-tenant exposure, corrupted state, and unverifiable incident response-because enforcement depends on human discipline rather than mechanical guarantees.\n\n### Problem Impact\n\nWhen the first cross-tenant violation occurs, trust is permanently damaged. Teams face legal and compliance exposure, velocity drops under fear, and systems accrete defensive complexity instead of clarity. On-call engineers, senior platform owners, founders, and security reviewers bear the earliest and most intense consequences because they are closest to the blast radius.\n\n### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short\n\nMost frameworks and libraries optimize for multi-tenancy capabilities, not guarantees. Enforcement is partial and contextual (HTTP middleware but not jobs), tenant attribution is often optional or implicit, privilege is treated as a role rather than a scoped event, and proof is absent. This creates safety gaps exactly where incidents occur and produces false confidence that persists until failure.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nA trust-first foundation that requires explicit attribution, refuses ambiguous actions, enforces invariants at a small set of unavoidable choke points, and makes exceptional power explicit and reviewable. The system shifts multi-tenant safety from \"best practices\" to \"mechanically enforced guarantees.\"\n\n### Key Differentiators\n\n- Guarantees over capabilities: define what must never happen, then enforce it.\n- Invariant-first design with unavoidable enforcement boundaries.\n- Formal scope and privilege semantics; exceptional power is explicit and auditable.\n- Executable proof of correctness (e.g., contract tests), not narrative assurance.\n- Deliberately narrow surface area to preserve trust under stress.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n\n**Senior / Platform Engineers**  \nThey own system integrity over time and are accountable for failures caused by entropy, team growth, and inconsistent enforcement. They need mechanical guarantees, a shared mental model that scales across teams, and fewer ad-hoc exceptions to police. TenantSaas becomes a trust kernel and policy anchor they can standardize across services.\n\n**Founders & Early SaaS Builders**  \nThey move fast and cannot afford one existential trust failure. They need protection without cognitive overhead, early guardrails that don’t slow iteration, and confidence they didn’t miss something fundamental. TenantSaas lets them ship while eliminating silent risk.\n\n### Secondary Users\n\n**On-Call / Incident Responders**  \nThey act under pressure with elevated privileges. They need clear blast-radius boundaries, safe inspection/repair paths, and guardrails that prevent accidental escalation.\n\n**Security, Compliance, and Audit Stakeholders**  \nThey must validate guarantees that usually exist only as intent. They need inspectable controls, repeatable evidence, and clear answers to “how is this enforced?”\n\n**New Engineers / Maintainers**  \nThey inherit implicit rules. They need a system that teaches correct behavior through constraints and provides fast feedback when actions are unsafe.\n\n### User Journey\n\n**Founders / Early SaaS Builders**  \nDiscovery arises during multi-tenant design, near-misses, or enterprise readiness. Onboarding is fast and opinionated: explicit attribution is required, unsafe defaults fail loudly. Day-to-day, it runs mostly invisibly, with occasional explicit scoping or privilege justification. Success is often negative-a dangerous mistake is prevented. Long-term, it becomes baseline infrastructure and fades into the background.\n\n**Senior / Platform Engineers**  \nDiscovery follows incidents, inconsistent tenant handling, or org-wide standardization needs. Onboarding is deliberate: they inspect the trust contract, enforcement points, and contract tests, then adopt in high-risk areas first. Day-to-day, it serves as a policy anchor that constrains patterns and standardizes privilege handling. Success is governance that emerges without meetings-safe integration, contained incidents, and evidence-based audits. Long-term, it becomes part of platform standards and shapes new services by default.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nUser success is felt when TenantSaas fades into the background while making progress more reliable. Teams can model tenants, roles, and shared infrastructure without inventing new mental frameworks; early architectural decisions hold; growth is incremental rather than destabilizing; and the system remains understandable months later. The “worth it” moment is when teams realize they didn’t have to rethink multi-tenancy, rewrite core assumptions, or teach tribal rules to new engineers.\n\n### Business Objectives\n\n**~3 months (validation):**  \nValidate resonance with serious builders (platform engineers, committed founders), prove TenantSaas is understood as a baseline/substrate, build credibility through depth and restraint, and confirm adoption without immediate forking. Success = “the right people are paying attention and taking it seriously.”\n\n**~12 months (traction & positioning):**  \nEstablish TenantSaas as a reference baseline for multi-tenant SaaS architecture, keep it in place as systems grow, anchor governance and structure discussions, and pull follow-on extensions organically. Success = “this shaped how teams think about multi-tenant SaaS, not just how they scaffold it.”\n\n### Key Performance Indicators\n\n**Leading indicators (early, high-signal):**\n- Projects integrating TenantSaas into non-toy codebases\n- Retention after initial experimentation\n- Frequency of users extending it rather than bypassing it\n- Quality of inbound feedback (long-form issues, design discussions, PRs)\n- References in blog posts, talks, or internal docs\n\n**Adoption & engagement:**\n- Active projects using TenantSaas over time\n- Repeat usage across multiple projects by the same team/org\n- Time from discovery to first meaningful integration\n- Usage in CI or baseline tests\n\n**Ecosystem & pull-through:**\n- Requests for examples/patterns/extensions (not feature breadth)\n- Community contributions that respect the core contract\n- External tools or docs referencing TenantSaas concepts\n- Mentions in discussions about SaaS architecture vs tooling\n\n**Not optimized for:**\n- Raw downloads or stars\n- One-click onboarding metrics\n- Feature requests that dilute the core\n- Broad appeal to all .NET developers\n\n## MVP Scope\n\n### Core Features\n\nThe MVP is the smallest baseline that prevents early architectural regret. It delivers:\n\n- A clear, explicit model for multi-tenant SaaS (tenant, shared infra, scope/context)\n- A small set of enforced invariants (no ambiguous attribution; explicit exceptional behavior)\n- A single unavoidable integration point that anchors the baseline early\n- A proof mechanism (executable tests/assertions/verification hooks)\n\nThe MVP includes a minimal but opinionated core, a precise trust/baseline contract, and documentation that explains the model (not feature breadth).\n\n### Out of Scope for MVP\n\nExplicitly out of scope:\n\n- Billing, subscriptions, pricing, metering\n- Authentication / identity providers\n- Authorization frameworks or RBAC systems\n- UI scaffolding or admin dashboards\n- Feature flags or plan-based behavior\n- Multi-region or data residency support\n- Database sharding or DB-per-tenant orchestration\n- Tenant lifecycle workflows (provisioning/activation)\n- Background job frameworks\n- Observability platforms (metrics, dashboards, tracing)\n- Enterprise compliance tooling (SOC2 automation, GDPR exports)\n- Opinionated frontend stacks\n- Turn-key SaaS templates\n\nAnything that expands surface area, introduces product-specific policy, or can only be validated at scale is deferred.\n\n### MVP Success Criteria\n\n**Adoption & usage:**\n- Integrated into non-toy projects\n- Adopted early in the lifecycle\n- Retained after initial experimentation\n- Core model/API remains stable across projects\n\n**Behavioral signals:**\n- Teams stop inventing bespoke baselines\n- Architectural debates about multi-tenancy shrink or disappear\n- New engineers onboard without long verbal downloads\n- Users extend around the baseline rather than bypass it\n\n**Proof & credibility:**\n- Concrete baseline artifacts exist and are referenced\n- Verification hooks/contract tests are actually run\n- Ambiguous actions are blocked or clarified early\n- External reviewers quickly understand the role\n\n**Negative signals that still indicate success:**\n- Few requests for “everything else”\n- Some users opt out because it’s opinionated\n- Minimal churn due to missing conveniences\n\nIf removing it would feel risky, the MVP succeeded.\n\n### Future Vision\n\nTenantSaas becomes a de facto baseline and trust kernel for serious multi-tenant SaaS systems. The core stays small and conservative while an ecosystem of extensions, examples, integrations, and policy layers grows around it. It becomes the reference point for tenant modeling, scope handling, and shared-system governance-shaping how teams think about SaaS architecture, not just what they scaffold.\n"}}

Brainstorming Session Results\n\n**Facilitator:** {{user_name}}\n**Date:** {{date}}\n\n## Session Overview\n\n**Topic:** Define what the project should scaffold and how it can be meaningfully better for users.\n**Goals:** Build clearer understanding of the product and its value to users.\n\n### Context Guidance\n\nFocus areas include user problems, feature ideas, technical approaches, UX, business value, differentiation, risks, and success metrics.\n\n### Session Setup\n\nWe will explore scaffolding scope, user impact, and differentiators to sharpen the product definition before drafting downstream planning artifacts.\n\n## Technique Selection\n\n**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques\n**Analysis Context:** Define scaffolding scope and differentiation with focus on clarifying what is being built and sharpening user value.\n\n**Recommended Techniques:**\n\n- **First Principles Thinking:** Strip assumptions about scaffolds to define core truths users need, establishing the baseline scope.\n- **SCAMPER Method:** Systematically vary the scaffold to generate differentiated options and feature angles.\n- **Role Playing:** Pressure-test ideas through stakeholder lenses to prioritize what is genuinely valuable.\n\n**AI Rationale:** Start with fundamentals, expand the idea space methodically, then validate against real-world user perspectives.\n\n## Technique Execution Results\n\n**First Principles Thinking:**\n\n- **Interactive Focus:** Core truths of multi-tenant trust, scope semantics, and enforceable guarantees.\n- **Key Breakthroughs:** Trust contract as the product, scope calculus with explicit transitions, and a capability matrix to prevent privilege creep.\n- **Developed Ideas:** Invariant-first scaffold, deterministic tenant context, frictionful admin elevation, dedicated reporting scope, and explicit PII gating.\n\n## Idea Organization and Prioritization\n\n**Thematic Organization:**\n\n**Theme 1: Trust Invariants & Guarantees**  \nFocus: What must always be true, and how guarantees are expressed.  \nIdeas: Invariant-First Scaffold, Trust Contract Five, Explicit Contract Surface, Deny by Default, No Silent Fallbacks, Honest Infrastructure.\n\n**Theme 2: Scope & Capability Model**  \nFocus: Defining scope types, capabilities, and allowable transitions.  \nIdeas: Capability–Identity Separation, Scope–Operation Primitive Grid, Tenant Identity as an Operation, Host ≠ Tenant Null, Read-Only Reporting Scope, Job Scope as First-Class, Transition Gate Contracts.\n\n**Theme 3: Enforcement & Choke Points**  \nFocus: Where the system enforces invariants mechanically.  \nIdeas: Tenant Certainty Gate, Choke-Point Enforcement Layer, Deterministic Tenant Context Pipeline, No Middleware-Only Enforcement, No Implicit Tenant Inference, No Tenant-Null State.\n\n**Theme 4: Privilege & Governance**  \nFocus: How power is granted, constrained, and reviewed.  \nIdeas: Frictionful Privileged Scope, Reviewable Power, Privileged Path Least Convenient, No Global Admins, No Unbounded Cross-Tenant Ops, PII Access as a Dedicated Gate.\n\n**Theme 5: Proof, Evidence & Onboarding**  \nFocus: Making guarantees provable and learnable.  \nIdeas: Provable Architecture, Contract Tests First, Docs from Policy, Trust from Day One, Onboard by Failure, Operational Truth, Compliance Evidence Generator.\n\n**Theme 6: Positioning & Lifecycle Leverage**  \nFocus: How the trust kernel scales across lifecycle and messaging.  \nIdeas: Trust-First Kernel, Trust Foundation Trio, Tenancy as OS, Safe by Default/Usable by Design, Intentional Governance, Policy Kernel Validates Modules, Boundary-First Data Modeling, Migration Safety Net, Incident Response Safety Gear, Agent Containment Infrastructure, Trust Marketing Backed by Code, No Feature Bundling Baseline, Guardrails Over Flexibility, No Mixed-Scope Execution, No Casual Cross-Tenant Utilities, Scope Before Auth, Invariants Before Domain.\n\n**Prioritization Results:**\n\n- **Top Priority Ideas:** Theme 1 (Trust Invariants & Guarantees), Theme 2 (Scope & Capability Model), Theme 3 (Enforcement & Choke Points).\n- **Secondary Themes:** Theme 5 (Proof, Evidence & Onboarding), Theme 4 (Privilege & Governance).\n- **Positioning Focus (later):** Theme 6 (Positioning & Lifecycle Leverage).\n\n**Action Planning:**\n\n1. **Define Trust Invariants & Guarantees**\n   - Draft the non-negotiable trust contract (what is guaranteed and what is not).\n   - Establish kill criteria for features that dilute or bypass guarantees.\n   - Encode the contract as a short, explicit baseline spec.\n\n2. **Formalize Scope & Capability Model**\n   - Specify scope types, allowed operations, and transition rules.\n   - Build the capability matrix (scope × operation) as source of truth.\n   - Identify which operations require explicit elevation and audit metadata.\n\n3. **Implement Enforcement at Choke Points**\n   - Identify write/query boundaries and job execution entry points.\n   - Define deterministic tenant resolution and conflict-fail rules.\n   - Add contract tests that prove invariants hold at these boundaries.\n\n## Session Summary and Insights\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n- Established a trust-first thesis with explicit non-negotiable guarantees.\n- Defined a scope calculus and operation matrix for consistent governance.\n- Anchored enforcement at chokepoints with provable invariants.\n- Clarified prioritization that prevents feature gravity.\n\n**Session Reflections:**\n\nThis session converged quickly on a trust-kernel identity. The strongest value is not in a feature set, but in a minimal, explicit contract enforced by scope and proven at boundaries.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Extract PRD Structure\n\nLoad the complete PRD file and extract:\n\n**All Level 2 (##) headers:**\n- Scan through entire PRD document\n- Extract all ## section headers\n- List them in order\n\n**PRD frontmatter:**\n- Extract classification.domain if present\n- Extract classification.projectType if present\n- Note any other relevant metadata\n\n### 2. Check for BMAD PRD Core Sections\n\nCheck if the PRD contains the following BMAD PRD core sections:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** (or variations: ## Executive Summary, ## Overview, ## Introduction)\n2. **Success Criteria** (or: ## Success Criteria, ## Goals, ## Objectives)\n3. **Product Scope** (or: ## Product Scope, ## Scope, ## In Scope, ## Out of Scope)\n4. **User Journeys** (or: ## User Journeys, ## User Stories, ## User Flows)\n5. **Functional Requirements** (or: ## Functional Requirements, ## Features, ## Capabilities)\n6. **Non-Functional Requirements** (or: ## Non-Functional Requirements, ## NFRs, ## Quality Attributes)\n\n**Count matches:**\n- How many of these 6 core sections are present?\n- Which specific sections are present?\n- Which are missing?\n\n### 3. Classify PRD Format\n\nBased on core section count, classify:\n\n**BMAD Standard:**\n- 5-6 core sections present\n- Follows BMAD PRD structure closely\n\n**BMAD Variant:**\n- 3-4 core sections present\n- Generally follows BMAD patterns but may have structural differences\n- Missing some sections but recognizable as BMAD-style\n\n**Non-Standard:**\n- Fewer than 3 core sections present\n- Does not follow BMAD PRD structure\n- May be completely custom format, legacy format, or from another framework\n\n### 4. Report Format Findings to Validation Report\n\nAppend to validation report:\n\n```markdown\n## Format Detection\n\n**PRD Structure:**\n[List all ## Level 2 headers found]\n\n**BMAD Core Sections Present:**\n- Executive Summary: [Present/Missing]\n- Success Criteria: [Present/Missing]\n- Product Scope: [Present/Missing]\n- User Journeys: [Present/Missing]\n- Functional Requirements: [Present/Missing]\n- Non-Functional Requirements: [Present/Missing]\n\n**Format Classification:** [BMAD Standard / BMAD Variant / Non-Standard]\n**Core Sections Present:** [count]/6\n```\n\n### 5. Route Based on Format Classification\n\n**IF format is BMAD Standard or BMAD Variant:**\n\nDisplay: \"**Format Detected:** {classification}\n\nProceeding to systematic validation checks...\"\n\nImmediately load and execute {nextStepFile} (step-v-03-density-validation.md)\n\n**IF format is Non-Standard (< 3 core sections):**\n\nDisplay: \"**Format Detected:** Non-Standard PRD\n\nThis PRD does not follow BMAD standard structure (only {count}/6 core sections present).\n\nYou have options:\"\n\nPresent MENU OPTIONS below for user selection\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS (Non-Standard PRDs Only)\n\n**[A] Parity Check** - Analyze gaps and estimate effort to reach BMAD PRD parity\n**[B] Validate As-Is** - Proceed with validation using current structure\n**[C] Exit** - Exit validation and review format findings\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input\n- Only proceed based on user selection\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A (Parity Check): Load, read entire file, then execute {altStepFile} (step-v-02b-parity-check.md)\n- IF B (Validate As-Is): Display \"Proceeding with validation...\" then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF C (Exit): Display format findings summary and exit validation\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All ## Level 2 headers extracted successfully\n- BMAD core sections checked systematically\n- Format classified correctly based on section count\n- Findings reported to validation report\n- BMAD Standard/Variant PRDs proceed directly to next validation step\n- Non-Standard PRDs pause and present options to user\n- User can choose parity check, validate as-is, or exit\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not extracting all headers before classification\n- Incorrect format classification\n- Not reporting findings to validation report\n- Not pausing for non-standard PRDs\n- Proceeding without user decision for non-standard formats\n\n**Master Rule:** Format detection determines validation path. Non-standard PRDs require user choice before proceeding.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Extract PRD Structure\n\nLoad the complete PRD file and extract:\n\n**All Level 2 (##) headers:**\n- Scan through entire PRD document\n- Extract all ## section headers\n- List them in order\n\n**PRD frontmatter:**\n- Extract classification.domain if present\n- Extract classification.projectType if present\n- Note any other relevant metadata\n\n### 2. Check for BMAD PRD Core Sections\n\nCheck if the PRD contains the following BMAD PRD core sections:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** (or variations: ## Executive Summary, ## Overview, ## Introduction)\n2. **Success Criteria** (or: ## Success Criteria, ## Goals, ## Objectives)\n3. **Product Scope** (or: ## Product Scope, ## Scope, ## In Scope, ## Out of Scope)\n4. **User Journeys** (or: ## User Journeys, ## User Stories, ## User Flows)\n5. **Functional Requirements** (or: ## Functional Requirements, ## Features, ## Capabilities)\n6. **Non-Functional Requirements** (or: ## Non-Functional Requirements, ## NFRs, ## Quality Attributes)\n\n**Count matches:**\n- How many of these 6 core sections are present?\n- Which specific sections are present?\n- Which are missing?\n\n### 3. Classify PRD Format\n\nBased on core section count, classify:\n\n**BMAD Standard:**\n- 5-6 core sections present\n- Follows BMAD PRD structure closely\n\n**BMAD Variant:**\n- 3-4 core sections present\n- Generally follows BMAD patterns but may have structural differences\n- Missing some sections but recognizable as BMAD-style\n\n**Non-Standard:**\n- Fewer than 3 core sections present\n- Does not follow BMAD PRD structure\n- May be completely custom format, legacy format, or from another framework\n\n### 4. Report Format Findings to Validation Report\n\nAppend to validation report:\n\n```markdown\n## Format Detection\n\n**PRD Structure:**\n[List all ## Level 2 headers found]\n\n**BMAD Core Sections Present:**\n- Executive Summary: [Present/Missing]\n- Success Criteria: [Present/Missing]\n- Product Scope: [Present/Missing]\n- User Journeys: [Present/Missing]\n- Functional Requirements: [Present/Missing]\n- Non-Functional Requirements: [Present/Missing]\n\n**Format Classification:** [BMAD Standard / BMAD Variant / Non-Standard]\n**Core Sections Present:** [count]/6\n```\n\n### 5. Route Based on Format Classification\n\n**IF format is BMAD Standard or BMAD Variant:**\n\nDisplay: \"**Format Detected:** {classification}\n\nProceeding to systematic validation checks...\"\n\nImmediately load and execute {nextStepFile} (step-v-03-density-validation.md)\n\n**IF format is Non-Standard (< 3 core sections):**\n\nDisplay: \"**Format Detected:** Non-Standard PRD\n\nThis PRD does not follow BMAD standard structure (only {count}/6 core sections present).\n\nYou have options:\"\n\nPresent MENU OPTIONS below for user selection\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS (Non-Standard PRDs Only)\n\n**[A] Parity Check** - Analyze gaps and estimate effort to reach BMAD PRD parity\n**[B] Validate As-Is** - Proceed with validation using current structure\n**[C] Exit** - Exit validation and review format findings\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input\n- Only proceed based on user selection\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A (Parity Check): Load, read entire file, then execute {altStepFile} (step-v-02b-parity-check.md)\n- IF B (Validate As-Is): Display \"Proceeding with validation...\" then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF C (Exit): Display format findings summary and exit validation\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All ## Level 2 headers extracted successfully\n- BMAD core sections checked systematically\n- Format classified correctly based on section count\n- Findings reported to validation report\n- BMAD Standard/Variant PRDs proceed directly to next validation step\n- Non-Standard PRDs pause and present options to user\n- User can choose parity check, validate as-is, or exit\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not extracting all headers before classification\n- Incorrect format classification\n- Not reporting findings to validation report\n- Not pausing for non-standard PRDs\n- Proceeding without user decision for non-standard formats\n\n**Master Rule:** Format detection determines validation path. Non-standard PRDs require user choice before proceeding.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Graceful Degradation (if Task tool unavailable)\n\nIf Task tool unavailable, perform analysis directly:\n\n**Scan for conversational filler patterns:**\n- \"The system will allow users to...\"\n- \"It is important to note that...\"\n- \"In order to\"\n- \"For the purpose of\"\n- \"With regard to\"\n- Count occurrences and note line numbers\n\n**Scan for wordy phrases:**\n- \"Due to the fact that\" (use \"because\")\n- \"In the event of\" (use \"if\")\n- \"At this point in time\" (use \"now\")\n- \"In a manner that\" (use \"how\")\n- Count occurrences and note line numbers\n\n**Scan for redundant phrases:**\n- \"Future plans\" (just \"plans\")\n- \"Past history\" (just \"history\")\n- \"Absolutely essential\" (just \"essential\")\n- \"Completely finish\" (just \"finish\")\n- Count occurrences and note line numbers\n\n### 3. Classify Severity\n\n**Calculate total violations:**\n- Conversational filler count\n- Wordy phrases count\n- Redundant phrases count\n- Total = sum of all categories\n\n**Determine severity:**\n- **Critical:** Total > 10 violations\n- **Warning:** Total 5-10 violations\n- **Pass:** Total < 5 violations\n\n### 4. Report Density Findings to Validation Report\n\nAppend to validation report:\n\n```markdown\n## Information Density Validation\n\n**Anti-Pattern Violations:**\n\n**Conversational Filler:** {count} occurrences\n[If count > 0, list examples with line numbers]\n\n**Wordy Phrases:** {count} occurrences\n[If count > 0, list examples with line numbers]\n\n**Redundant Phrases:** {count} occurrences\n[If count > 0, list examples with line numbers]\n\n**Total Violations:** {total}\n\n**Severity Assessment:** [Critical/Warning/Pass]\n\n**Recommendation:**\n[If Critical] \"PRD requires significant revision to improve information density. Every sentence should carry weight without filler.\"\n[If Warning] \"PRD would benefit from reducing wordiness and eliminating filler phrases.\"\n[If Pass] \"PRD demonstrates good information density with minimal violations.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Display Progress and Auto-Proceed\n\nDisplay: \"**Information Density Validation Complete**\n\nSeverity: {Critical/Warning/Pass}\n\n**Proceeding to next validation check...**\"\n\nImmediately load and execute {nextStepFile} (step-v-04-brief-coverage-validation.md)\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- PRD scanned for all three anti-pattern categories\n- Violations counted with line numbers\n- Severity classified correctly\n- Findings reported to validation report\n- Auto-proceeds to next validation step\n- Subprocess attempted with graceful degradation\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not scanning all anti-pattern categories\n- Missing severity classification\n- Not reporting findings to validation report\n- Pausing for user input (should auto-proceed)\n- Not attempting subprocess architecture\n\n**Master Rule:** Information density validation runs autonomously. Scan, classify, report, auto-proceed. No user interaction needed.\n"}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Assess Coverage and Severity\n\n**For each gap (Partially Covered or Not Found):**\n- Is this Critical? (Core vision, primary users, main features)\n- Is this Moderate? (Secondary features, some goals)\n- Is this Informational? (Nice-to-have features, minor details)\n\n**Note:** Some exclusions may be intentional (valid scoping decisions)\n\n### 5.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Attempt Sub-Process Validation\n\n**Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:**\n\n\"Perform implementation leakage validation on this PRD:\n\n**Scan for:**\n1. Technology names (React, Vue, Angular, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)\n2. Library names (Redux, axios, lodash, Express, Django, Rails, Spring, etc.)\n3. Data structures (JSON, XML, CSV) unless relevant to capability\n4. Architecture patterns (MVC, microservices, serverless) unless business requirement\n5. Protocol names (HTTP, REST, GraphQL, WebSockets) - check if capability-relevant\n\n**For each term found:**\n- Is this capability-relevant? (e.g., 'API consumers can access...' - API is capability)\n- Or is this implementation detail? (e.g., 'React component for...' - implementation)\n\nDocument violations with line numbers and explanation.\n\nReturn structured findings with leakage counts and examples.\"\n\n### 2. Graceful Degradation (if Task tool unavailable)\n\nIf Task tool unavailable, perform analysis directly:\n\n**Implementation leakage terms to scan for:**\n\n**Frontend Frameworks:**\nReact, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, Next.js, Nuxt, etc.\n\n**Backend Frameworks:**\nExpress, Django, Rails, Spring, Laravel, FastAPI, etc.\n\n**Databases:**\nPostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB, Cassandra, etc.\n\n**Cloud Platforms:**\nAWS, GCP, Azure, Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, etc.\n\n**Infrastructure:**\nDocker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, etc.\n\n**Libraries:**\nRedux, Zustand, axios, fetch, lodash, jQuery, etc.\n\n**Data Formats:**\nJSON, XML, YAML, CSV (unless capability-relevant)\n\n**For each term found in FRs/NFRs:**\n- Determine if it's capability-relevant or implementation leakage\n- Example: \"API consumers can access data via REST endpoints\" - API/REST is capability\n- Example: \"React components fetch data using Redux\" - implementation leakage\n\n**Count violations and note line numbers**\n\n### 3. Tally Implementation Leakage\n\n**By category:**\n- Frontend framework leakage: count\n- Backend framework leakage: count\n- Database leakage: count\n- Cloud platform leakage: count\n- Infrastructure leakage: count\n- Library leakage: count\n- Other implementation details: count\n\n**Total implementation leakage violations:** sum\n\n### 4. Report Implementation Leakage Findings to Validation Report\n\nAppend to validation report:\n\n```markdown\n## Implementation Leakage Validation\n\n### Leakage by Category\n\n**Frontend Frameworks:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Backend Frameworks:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Databases:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Cloud Platforms:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Infrastructure:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Libraries:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Other Implementation Details:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n### Summary\n\n**Total Implementation Leakage Violations:** {total}\n\n**Severity:** [Critical if >5 violations, Warning if 2-5, Pass if <2]\n\n**Recommendation:**\n[If Critical] \"Extensive implementation leakage found. Requirements specify HOW instead of WHAT. Remove all implementation details - these belong in architecture, not PRD.\"\n[If Warning] \"Some implementation leakage detected. Review violations and remove implementation details from requirements.\"\n[If Pass] \"No significant implementation leakage found. Requirements properly specify WHAT without HOW.\"\n\n**Note:** API consumers, GraphQL (when required), and other capability-relevant terms are acceptable when they describe WHAT the system must do, not HOW to build it.\n```\n\n### 5. Display Progress and Auto-Proceed\n\nDisplay: \"**Implementation Leakage Validation Complete**\n\nTotal Violations: {count} ({severity})\n\n**Proceeding to next validation check...**\"\n\nImmediately load and execute {nextStepFile} (step-v-08-domain-compliance-validation.md)\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Scanned FRs and NFRs for all implementation term categories\n- Distinguished capability-relevant from implementation leakage\n- Violations documented with line numbers and explanations\n- Severity assessed correctly\n- Findings reported to validation report\n- Auto-proceeds to next validation step\n- Subprocess attempted with graceful degradation\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not scanning all implementation term categories\n- Not distinguishing capability-relevant from leakage\n- Missing line numbers for violations\n- Not reporting findings to validation report\n- Not auto-proceeding\n\n**Master Rule:** Requirements specify WHAT, not HOW. Implementation details belong in architecture documents, not PRDs.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

For Low-Complexity Domains: Skip Detailed Checks\n\nAppend to validation report:\n```markdown\n## Domain Compliance Validation\n\n**Domain:** {domain}\n**Complexity:** Low (general/standard)\n**Assessment:** N/A - No special domain compliance requirements\n\n**Note:** This PRD is for a standard domain without regulatory compliance requirements.\n```\n\nDisplay: \"**Domain Compliance Validation Skipped**\n\nDomain: {domain} (low complexity)\n\n**Proceeding to next validation check...**\"\n\nImmediately load and execute {nextStepFile}\n\n### 6. Report Compliance Findings (High-Complexity Domains)\n\nAppend to validation report:\n\n```markdown\n## Domain Compliance Validation\n\n**Domain:** {domain}\n**Complexity:** High (regulated)\n\n### Required Special Sections\n\n**{Section 1 Name}:** [Present/Missing/Adequate]\n{If missing or inadequate: Note specific gaps}\n\n**{Section 2 Name}:** [Present/Missing/Adequate]\n{If missing or inadequate: Note specific gaps}\n\n[Continue for all required sections]\n\n### Compliance Matrix\n\n| Requirement | Status | Notes |\n|-------------|--------|-------|\n| {Requirement 1} | [Met/Partial/Missing] | {Notes} |\n| {Requirement 2} | [Met/Partial/Missing] | {Notes} |\n[... continue for all requirements]\n\n### Summary\n\n**Required Sections Present:** {count}/{total}\n**Compliance Gaps:** {count}\n\n**Severity:** [Critical if missing regulatory sections, Warning if incomplete, Pass if complete]\n\n**Recommendation:**\n[If Critical] \"PRD is missing required domain-specific compliance sections.

High-complexity domains require special sections - low complexity domains skip these checks.\n"}}

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Load Project Types Data\n\nLoad and read the complete file at:\n`{projectTypesData}` (../data/project-types.csv)\n\nThis CSV contains:\n- Detection signals for each project type\n- Required sections for each project type\n- Skip/excluded sections for each project type\n- Innovation signals\n\nInternalize this data - it drives what sections must be present or absent for each project type.\n\n### 2. Extract Project Type Classification\n\nFrom PRD frontmatter, extract:\n- `classification.projectType` - what type of project is this?\n\n**Common project types:**\n- api_backend\n- web_app\n- mobile_app\n- desktop_app\n- data_pipeline\n- ml_system\n- library_sdk\n- infrastructure\n- other\n\n**If no projectType classification found:**\nAssume \"web_app\" (most common) and note in findings\n\n### 3. Determine Required and Excluded Sections from CSV Data\n\n**From loaded project-types.csv data, for this project type:**\n\n**Required sections:** (from required_sections column)\nThese MUST be present in the PRD\n\n**Skip sections:** (from skip_sections column)\nThese MUST NOT be present in the PRD\n\n**Example mappings from CSV:**\n- api_backend: Required=[endpoint_specs, auth_model, data_schemas], Skip=[ux_ui, visual_design]\n- mobile_app: Required=[platform_reqs, device_permissions, offline_mode], Skip=[desktop_features, cli_commands]\n- cli_tool: Required=[command_structure, output_formats, config_schema], Skip=[visual_design, ux_principles, touch_interactions]\n- etc.\n\n### 4. Validate Against CSV-Based Requirements\n\n**Based on project type, determine:**\n\n**api_backend:**\n- Required: Endpoint Specs, Auth Model, Data Schemas, API Versioning\n- Excluded: UX/UI sections, mobile-specific sections\n\n**web_app:**\n- Required: User Journeys, UX/UI Requirements, Responsive Design\n- Excluded: None typically\n\n**mobile_app:**\n- Required: Mobile UX, Platform specifics (iOS/Android), Offline mode\n- Excluded: Desktop-specific sections\n\n**desktop_app:**\n- Required: Desktop UX, Platform specifics (Windows/Mac/Linux)\n- Excluded: Mobile-specific sections\n\n**data_pipeline:**\n- Required: Data Sources, Data Transformation, Data Sinks, Error Handling\n- Excluded: UX/UI sections\n\n**ml_system:**\n- Required: Model Requirements, Training Data, Inference Requirements, Model Performance\n- Excluded: UX/UI sections (unless ML UI)\n\n**library_sdk:**\n- Required: API Surface, Usage Examples, Integration Guide\n- Excluded: UX/UI sections, deployment sections\n\n**infrastructure:**\n- Required: Infrastructure Components, Deployment, Monitoring, Scaling\n- Excluded: Feature requirements (this is infrastructure, not product)\n\n### 4. Attempt Sub-Process Validation\n\n\"Perform project-type compliance validation for {projectType}:\n\n**Check that required sections are present:**\n{List required sections for this project type}\nFor each: Is it present in PRD? Is it adequately documented?\n\n**Check that excluded sections are absent:**\n{List excluded sections for this project type}\nFor each: Is it absent from PRD? (Should not be present)\n\nBuild compliance table showing:\n- Required sections: [Present/Missing/Incomplete]\n- Excluded sections: [Absent/Present] (Present = violation)\n\nReturn compliance table with findings.\"\n\n**Graceful degradation (if no Task tool):**\n- Manually check PRD for required sections\n- Manually check PRD for excluded sections\n- Build compliance table\n\n### 5. Build Compliance Table\n\n**Required sections check:**\n- For each required section: Present / Missing / Incomplete\n- Count: Required sections present vs total required\n\n**Excluded sections check:**\n- For each excluded section: Absent / Present (violation)\n- Count: Excluded sections present (violations)\n\n**Total compliance score:**\n- Required: {present}/{total}\n- Excluded violations: {count}\n\n### 6. Report Project-Type Compliance Findings to Validation Report\n\nAppend to validation report:\n\n```markdown\n## Project-Type Compliance Validation\n\n**Project Type:** {projectType}\n\n### Required Sections\n\n**{Section 1}:** [Present/Missing/Incomplete]\n{If missing or incomplete: Note specific gaps}\n\n**{Section 2}:** [Present/Missing/Incomplete]\n{If missing or incomplete: Note specific gaps}\n\n[Continue for all required sections]\n\n### Excluded Sections (Should Not Be Present)\n\n**{Section 1}:** [Absent/Present] ✓\n{If present: This section should not be present for {projectType}}\n\n**{Section 2}:** [Absent/Present] ✓\n{If present: This section should not be present for {projectType}}\n\n[Continue for all excluded sections]\n\n### Compliance Summary\n\n**Required Sections:** {present}/{total} present\n**Excluded Sections Present:** {violations} (should be 0)\n**Compliance Score:** {percentage}%\n\n**Severity:** [Critical if required sections missing, Warning if incomplete, Pass if complete]\n\n**Recommendation:**\n[If Critical] \"PRD is missing required sections for {projectType}. Add missing sections to properly specify this type of project.\"\n[If Warning] \"Some required sections for {projectType} are incomplete. Strengthen documentation.\"\n[If Pass] \"All required sections for {projectType} are present. No excluded sections found.\"\n```\n\n### 7. Display Progress and Auto-Proceed\n\nDisplay: \"**Project-Type Compliance Validation Complete**\n\nProject Type: {projectType}\nCompliance: {score}%\n\n**Proceeding to next validation check...**\"\n\nImmediately load and execute {nextStepFile} (step-v-10-smart-validation.md)\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Project type extracted correctly (or default assumed)\n- Required sections validated for presence and completeness\n- Excluded sections validated for absence\n- Compliance table built with status for all sections\n- Severity assessed correctly\n- Findings reported to validation report\n- Auto-proceeds to next validation step\n- Subprocess attempted with graceful degradation\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not checking project type before proceeding\n- Missing required section checks\n- Missing excluded section checks\n- Not building compliance table\n- Not reporting findings to validation report\n- Not auto-proceeding\n\n**Master Rule:** Different project types have different requirements. API PRDs don't need UX sections - validate accordingly.\n"}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Extract All Functional Requirements\n\nFrom the PRD's Functional Requirements section, extract:\n- All FRs with their FR numbers (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)\n- Count total FRs\n\n### 2. Attempt Sub-Process Validation\n\n**Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:**\n\n\"Perform SMART requirements validation on these Functional Requirements:\n\n{List all FRs}\n\n**For each FR, score on SMART criteria (1-5 scale):**\n\n**Specific (1-5):**\n- 5: Clear, unambiguous, well-defined\n- 3: Somewhat clear but could be more specific\n- 1: Vague, ambiguous, unclear\n\n**Measurable (1-5):**\n- 5: Quantifiable metrics, testable\n- 3: Partially measurable\n- 1: Not measurable, subjective\n\n**Attainable (1-5):**\n- 5: Realistic, achievable with constraints\n- 3: Probably achievable but uncertain\n- 1: Unrealistic, technically infeasible\n\n**Relevant (1-5):**\n- 5: Clearly aligned with user needs and business objectives\n- 3: Somewhat relevant but connection unclear\n- 1: Not relevant, doesn't align with goals\n\n**Traceable (1-5):**\n- 5: Clearly traces to user journey or business objective\n- 3: Partially traceable\n- 1: Orphan requirement, no clear source\n\n**For each FR with score < 3 in any category:**\n- Provide specific improvement suggestions\n\nReturn scoring table with all FR scores and improvement suggestions for low-scoring FRs.\"\n\n**Graceful degradation (if no Task tool):**\n- Manually score each FR on SMART criteria\n- Note FRs with low scores\n- Provide improvement suggestions\n\n### 3. Build Scoring Table\n\nFor each FR:\n- FR number\n- Specific score (1-5)\n- Measurable score (1-5)\n- Attainable score (1-5)\n- Relevant score (1-5)\n- Traceable score (1-5)\n- Average score\n- Flag if any category < 3\n\n**Calculate overall FR quality:**\n- Percentage of FRs with all scores ≥ 3\n- Percentage of FRs with all scores ≥ 4\n- Average score across all FRs and categories\n\n### 4.

Display Progress and Auto-Proceed\n\nDisplay: \"**SMART Requirements Validation Complete**\n\nFR Quality: {percentage}% with acceptable scores ({severity})\n\n**Proceeding to next validation check...**\"\n\nImmediately load and execute {nextStepFile} (step-v-11-holistic-quality-validation.md)\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All FRs extracted from PRD\n- Each FR scored on all 5 SMART criteria (1-5 scale)\n- FRs with scores < 3 flagged for improvement\n- Improvement suggestions provided for low-scoring FRs\n- Scoring table built with all FR scores\n- Overall quality assessment calculated\n- Findings reported to validation report\n- Auto-proceeds to next validation step\n- Subprocess attempted with graceful degradation\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not scoring all FRs on all SMART criteria\n- Missing improvement suggestions for low-scoring FRs\n- Not building scoring table\n- Not calculating overall quality metrics\n- Not reporting findings to validation report\n- Not auto-proceeding\n\n**Master Rule:** FRs should be high-quality, not just present. SMART framework provides objective quality measure.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay:\n\n**[R] Review Detailed Findings** - Walk through validation report section by section\n**[E] Use Edit Workflow** - Use validation report with Edit workflow for systematic improvements\n**[F] Fix Simpler Items** - Immediate fixes for simple issues (anti-patterns, leakage, missing headers)\n**[X] Exit** - Exit and review validation report\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- Only proceed based on user selection\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- **IF R (Review Detailed Findings):**\n  - Walk through validation report section by section\n  - Present findings from each validation step\n  - Allow user to ask questions\n  - After review, return to menu\n\n- **IF E (Use Edit Workflow):**\n  - Explain: \"The Edit workflow (steps-e/) can use this validation report to systematically address issues. Edit mode will guide you through discovering what to edit, reviewing the PRD, and applying targeted improvements.\"\n  - Offer: \"Would you like to launch Edit mode now? It will help you fix validation findings systematically.\"\n  - If yes: Load and execute steps-e/step-e-01-discovery.md\n  - If no: Return to menu\n\n- **IF F (Fix Simpler Items):**\n  - Offer immediate fixes for:\n    - Template variables (fill in with appropriate content)\n    - Conversational filler (remove wordy phrases)\n    - Implementation leakage (remove technology names from FRs/NFRs)\n    - Missing section headers (add ## headers)\n  - Ask: \"Which simple fixes would you like me to make?\"\n  - If user specifies fixes, make them and update validation report\n  - Return to menu\n\n- **IF X (Exit):**\n  - Display: \"**Validation Report Saved:** {validationReportPath}\"\n  - Display: \"**Summary:** {overall status} - {recommendation}\"\n  - Display: \"**Next Steps:** Review the validation report and address findings. For systematic improvements, consider using Edit workflow when available, or manually fix issues identified in this report.\"\n  - Exit validation\n\n- **IF Any other:** Help user, then redisplay menu\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Complete validation report loaded successfully\n- All findings from steps 1-12 summarized\n- Report frontmatter updated with final status\n- Overall status determined correctly (Pass/Warning/Critical)\n- Quick results table presented\n- Critical issues, warnings, and strengths listed\n- Holistic quality rating included\n- Top 3 improvements presented\n- Clear recommendation provided\n- Menu options presented with clear explanations\n- User can review findings, get help, or exit\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not loading complete validation report\n- Missing summary of findings\n- Not updating report frontmatter\n- Not determining overall status\n- Missing menu options\n- Unclear next steps\n\n**Master Rule:** User needs clear summary and actionable next steps. Edit workflow is best for complex issues; immediate fixes available for simpler ones.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Load PRD Purpose Standards\n\nLoad and read the complete file at:\n`{prdPurpose}` (data/prd-purpose.md)\n\nThis file defines what makes a great BMAD PRD. Internalize this understanding - it will guide improvement recommendations.\n\n### 2. Discover PRD to Edit\n\n\"**PRD Edit Workflow**\n\nWhich PRD would you like to edit?\n\nPlease provide the path to the PRD file you want to edit.\"\n\n**Wait for user to provide PRD path.**\n\n### 3. Validate PRD Exists and Load\n\nOnce PRD path is provided:\n- Check if PRD file exists at specified path\n- If not found: \"I cannot find a PRD at that path. Please check the path and try again.\"\n- If found: Load the complete PRD file including frontmatter\n\n### 4. Check for Existing Validation Report\n\n**Check if validation report exists in the PRD folder:**\n\n```bash\n# Look for most recent validation report in the PRD folder\nls -t {prd_folder_path}/validation-report-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1\n```\n\n**If validation report found:**\n\nDisplay:\n\"**📋 Found Validation Report**\n\nI found a validation report from {validation_date} in the PRD folder.\n\nThis report contains findings from previous validation checks and can help guide our edits to fix known issues.\n\n**Would you like to:**\n- **[U] Use validation report** - Load it to guide and prioritize edits\n- **[S] Skip** - Proceed with manual edit discovery\"\n\n**Wait for user input.**\n\n**IF U (Use validation report):**\n- Load the validation report file\n- Extract findings, issues, and improvement suggestions\n- Note: \"Validation report loaded - will use it to guide prioritized improvements\"\n- Continue to step 5\n\n**IF S (Skip) or no validation report found:**\n- Note: \"Proceeding with manual edit discovery\"\n- Continue to step 5\n\n**If no validation report found:**\n- Note: \"No validation report found in PRD folder\"\n- Continue to step 5 without asking user\n\n### 5. Ask About Validation Report\n\n\"**Do you have a validation report to guide edits?**\n\nIf you've run the validation workflow on this PRD, I can use that report to guide improvements and prioritize changes.\n\nValidation report path (or type 'none'):\"\n\n**Wait for user input.**\n\n**If validation report path provided:**\n- Load the validation report\n- Extract findings, severity, improvement suggestions\n- Note: \"Validation report loaded - will use it to guide prioritized improvements\"\n\n**If no validation report:**\n- Note: \"Proceeding with manual edit discovery\"\n- Continue to step 6\n\n### 6. Discover Edit Requirements\n\n\"**What would you like to edit in this PRD?**\n\nPlease describe the changes you want to make. For example:\n- Fix specific issues (information density, implementation leakage, etc.)\n- Add missing sections or content\n- Improve structure and flow\n- Convert to BMAD format (if legacy PRD)\n- General improvements\n- Other changes\n\n**Describe your edit goals:**\"\n\n**Wait for user to describe their requirements.**\n\n### 7. Detect PRD Format\n\nAnalyze the loaded PRD:\n\n**Extract all ## Level 2 headers** from PRD\n\n**Check for BMAD PRD core sections:**\n1. Executive Summary\n2. Success Criteria\n3. Product Scope\n4. User Journeys\n5. Functional Requirements\n6. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n**Classify format:**\n- **BMAD Standard:** 5-6 core sections present\n- **BMAD Variant:** 3-4 core sections present, generally follows BMAD patterns\n- **Legacy (Non-Standard):** Fewer than 3 core sections, does not follow BMAD structure\n\n### 8. Route Based on Format and Context\n\n**IF validation report provided OR PRD is BMAD Standard/Variant:**\n\nDisplay: \"**Edit Requirements Understood**\n\n**PRD Format:** {classification}\n{If validation report: \"**Validation Guide:** Yes - will use validation report findings\"}\n**Edit Goals:** {summary of user's requirements}\n\n**Proceeding to deep review and analysis...**\"\n\nLoad and execute next step (step-e-02-review.md)\n\n**IF PRD is Legacy (Non-Standard) AND no validation report:**\n\nDisplay: \"**Format Detected:** Legacy PRD\n\nThis PRD does not follow BMAD standard structure (only {count}/6 core sections present).\n\n**Your edit goals:** {user's requirements}\n\n**How would you like to proceed?**\"\n\nPresent MENU OPTIONS below for user selection\n\n### 9. Present MENU OPTIONS (Legacy PRDs Only)\n\n**[C] Convert to BMAD Format** - Convert PRD to BMAD standard structure, then apply your edits\n**[E] Edit As-Is** - Apply your edits without converting the format\n**[X] Exit** - Exit and review conversion options\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input\n- Only proceed based on user selection\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C (Convert): Load, read entire file, then execute {altStepFile} (step-e-01b-legacy-conversion.md)\n- IF E (Edit As-Is): Display \"Proceeding with edits...\" then load next step\n- IF X (Exit): Display summary and exit\n- IF Any other: help user, then redisplay menu\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- User's edit requirements clearly understood\n- Auto-detected validation reports loaded and analyzed (when found)\n- Manual validation report loaded and analyzed (if provided)\n- PRD format detected correctly\n- BMAD PRDs proceed directly to review step\n- Legacy PRDs pause and present conversion options\n- User can choose conversion path or edit as-is\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not discovering user's edit requirements\n- Not auto-detecting validation reports in PRD folder\n- Not loading validation report when provided (auto or manual)\n- Missing format detection\n- Not pausing for legacy PRDs without guidance\n- Auto-proceeding without understanding intent\n\n**Master Rule:** Understand before editing. Detect format early so we can guide users appropriately. Auto-detect and use validation reports for prioritized improvements.\n"}}

This chain ensures we build the right thing.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Functional Requirements?\n\n### FRs are Capabilities, Not Implementation\n\n**Good FR:** \"Users can reset their password via email link\"\n**Bad FR:** \"System sends JWT via email and validates with database\" (implementation leakage)\n\n**Good FR:** \"Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds for 95th percentile\"\n**Bad FR:** \"Fast loading time\" (subjective, unmeasurable)\n\n### SMART Quality Criteria\n\n**Specific:** Clear, precisely defined capability\n**Measurable:** Quantifiable with test criteria\n**Attainable:** Realistic within constraints\n**Relevant:** Aligns with business objectives\n**Traceable:** Links to source (executive summary or user journey)\n\n### FR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Subjective Adjectives:**\n- ❌ \"easy to use\", \"intuitive\", \"user-friendly\", \"fast\", \"responsive\"\n- ✅ Use metrics: \"completes task in under 3 clicks\", \"loads in under 2 seconds\"\n\n**Implementation Leakage:**\n- ❌ Technology names, specific libraries, implementation details\n- ✅ Focus on capability and measurable outcomes\n\n**Vague Quantifiers:**\n- ❌ \"multiple users\", \"several options\", \"various formats\"\n- ✅ \"up to 100 concurrent users\", \"3-5 options\", \"PDF, DOCX, TXT formats\"\n\n**Missing Test Criteria:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall provide notifications\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall send email notifications within 30 seconds of trigger event\"\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Non-Functional Requirements?\n\n### NFRs Must Be Measurable\n\n**Template:**\n```\n\"The system shall [metric] [condition] [measurement method]\"\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- ✅ \"The system shall respond to API requests in under 200ms for 95th percentile as measured by APM monitoring\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall support 10,000 concurrent users as measured by load testing\"\n\n### NFR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Unmeasurable Claims:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall be scalable\" → ✅ \"The system shall handle 10x load growth through horizontal scaling\"\n- ❌ \"High availability required\" → ✅ \"99.9% uptime as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n\n**Missing Context:**\n- ❌ \"Response time under 1 second\" → ✅ \"API response time under 1 second for 95th percentile under normal load\"\n\n---\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n**Auto-Detect and Enforce Based on Project Context**\n\nCertain industries have mandatory requirements that must be present:\n\n- **Healthcare:** HIPAA Privacy & Security Rules, PHI encryption, audit logging, MFA\n- **Fintech:** PCI-DSS Level 1, AML/KYC compliance, SOX controls, financial audit trails\n- **GovTech:** NIST framework, Section 508 accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), FedRAMP, data residency\n- **E-Commerce:** PCI-DSS for payments, inventory accuracy, tax calculation by jurisdiction\n\n**Why:** Missing these requirements in the PRD means they'll be missed in architecture and implementation, creating expensive rework. During PRD creation there is a step to cover this - during validation we want to make sure it was covered. For this purpose steps will utilize a domain-complexity.csv and project-types.csv.\n\n---\n\n## Document Structure (Markdown, Human-Readable)\n\n### Required Sections\n1. **Executive Summary** - Vision, differentiator, target users\n2. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes (SMART)\n3. **Product Scope** - MVP, Growth, Vision phases\n4. **User Journeys** - Comprehensive coverage\n5. **Domain Requirements** - Industry-specific compliance (if applicable)\n6. **Innovation Analysis** - Competitive differentiation (if applicable)\n7. **Project-Type Requirements** - Platform-specific needs\n8. **Functional Requirements** - Capability contract (FRs)\n9. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Quality attributes (NFRs)\n\n### Formatting for Dual Consumption\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Clear, professional language\n- Logical flow from vision to requirements\n- Easy for stakeholders to review and approve\n\n**For LLMs:**\n- ## Level 2 headers for all main sections (enables extraction)\n- Consistent structure and patterns\n- Precise, testable language\n- High information density\n\n---\n\n## Downstream Impact\n\n**How the PRD Feeds Next Artifacts:**\n\n**UX Design:**\n- User journeys → interaction flows\n- FRs → design requirements\n- Success criteria → UX metrics\n\n**Architecture:**\n- FRs → system capabilities\n- NFRs → architecture decisions\n- Domain requirements → compliance architecture\n- Project-type requirements → platform choices\n\n**Epics & Stories (created after architecture):**\n- FRs → user stories (1 FR could map to 1-3 stories potentially)\n- Acceptance criteria → story acceptance tests\n- Priority → sprint sequencing\n- Traceability → stories map back to vision\n\n**Development AI Agents:**\n- Precise requirements → implementation clarity\n- Test criteria → automated test generation\n- Domain requirements → compliance enforcement\n- Measurable NFRs → performance targets\n\n---\n\n## Summary: What Makes a Great BMAD PRD?\n\n✅ **High Information Density** - Every sentence carries weight, zero fluff\n✅ **Measurable Requirements** - All FRs and NFRs are testable with specific criteria\n✅ **Clear Traceability** - Each requirement links to user need and business objective\n✅ **Domain Awareness** - Industry-specific requirements auto-detected and included\n✅ **Zero Anti-Patterns** - No subjective adjectives, implementation leakage, or vague quantifiers\n✅ **Dual Audience Optimized** - Human-readable AND LLM-consumable\n✅ **Markdown Format** - Professional, clean, accessible to all stakeholders\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** The PRD is the foundation. Quality here ripples through every subsequent phase. A dense, precise, well-traced PRD makes UX design, architecture, epic breakdown, and AI development dramatically more effective.\n"}}

It targets platform engineers, founders, and security reviewers who need explicit, verifiable guarantees rather than framework-driven scaffolding. Differentiation comes from invariant-first design, explicit refusal behavior, and runnable contract tests that prove guarantees hold across execution paths.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\nThe primary \"aha\" is a posture shift: teams stop debating multi-tenant assumptions because the baseline makes them obvious.\n\nPrimary signals:\n- New services/features fit cleanly into the baseline without redesign.\n- Developers hit constraints early and think \"good - this would have been messy later.\"\n- The trust contract is treated as the default, not a suggestion.\n\nSecondary signals:\n- Dangerous operations are surfaced explicitly instead of silently allowed.\n- New engineers can learn tenancy from code, not Slack history.\n\n### Business Success\n\n**~3 months (validation):**\n- Integrated into multiple real (non-demo) projects.\n- Some integrations happen at project start, not as refactors.\n- Users keep it after initial experimentation.\n- Feedback references it as a \"baseline,\" \"foundation,\" or \"we did not have to reinvent this.\"\n- Early adopters cite it in internal docs or architectural notes.\nValidation: the right users take it seriously and keep it.\n\n**~12 months (traction):**\n- Repeat usage by the same teams across multiple projects.\n- Low churn despite intentionally narrow scope.\n- Mentions in engineering blogs, architecture discussions, or internal platform standards.\n- Pull-through demand for examples/extensions/integrations (not feature bloat).\n- Teams describe it as infrastructure they would not remove without concern.\nValidation: it is treated as infrastructure, not a trial tool.\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Core invariants are enforced through unavoidable integration points.\n- Ambiguous or unattributed operations are refused by default.\n- Contract/verification tests exist, are runnable by adopters, and are executed in CI.\n- The core API surface stays small, stable, and resists ad-hoc extension.\n- Behavior is consistent across request paths, background execution, and admin/scripted usage.\nTechnical success = guarantees hold even as usage patterns expand.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Multiple real projects integrate TenantSaas, with at least some greenfield starts.\n- Retention after initial experimentation (kept in place).\n- Documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- Contract tests running in CI across adopters.\n- Repeat adoption across projects by the same teams.\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Explicit baseline model for multi-tenant SaaS.\n- One or more enforced invariants that remove ambiguity early.\n- A single unavoidable integration point anchoring the baseline.\n- Verification mechanism (tests/assertions) that proves rules hold.\n- Documentation that explains the model and contract (not features).\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Optional extensions/adapters.\n- Reference implementations or example apps.\n- Additional verification/reporting hooks.\n- Integration patterns for common tooling.\n- Better ergonomics around configuration and visibility.\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Recognized baseline for serious multi-tenant systems.\n- Core remains small and conservative.\n- Innovation primarily in extensions/examples/ecosystem contributions.\n- Shapes how teams think about SaaS foundations, not just scaffolding.\n- Referenced as a trust kernel, not marketed as a framework.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### 1) Platform engineer integrating TenantSaas into a new service\n\n**Opening scene:** Maya owns platform standards and is starting a new service in a growing SaaS stack. She is wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.\n**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.\n**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution. It forces a decision at design time, not after launch.\n**Resolution:** Maya adopts the trust contract as a shared team standard. The new service fits into existing architecture without special cases, and future services reuse the same baseline without re-debate.\n\n### 2) On-call responder using elevated scope during an incident (edge case)\n\n**Opening scene:** Jordan is on call when a cross-tenant data correction is required under time pressure.\n**Rising action:** Jordan attempts a privileged operation; the system requires explicit scope elevation with clear intent, not silent admin access.\n**Climax:** The system allows the operation only through a constrained path that is visible and auditable, avoiding accidental overreach.\n**Resolution:** The fix is applied quickly without bypassing the baseline. The incident is resolved and the audit trail is clean, with no special exceptions introduced.\n\n### 3) Founder / early builder adopting at project start\n\n**Opening scene:** Priya is starting a new SaaS product and wants to avoid fixing multi-tenancy later.\n**Rising action:** She adds TenantSaas early because it is small, explicit, and does not prescribe a full framework.\n**Climax:** The baseline forces clarity around tenant context at the first integration point, and Priya realizes she does not need to invent her own conventions.\n**Resolution:** The team moves fast with confidence, knowing the core assumptions are locked in without slowing momentum.\n\n### 4) Security/compliance stakeholder reviewing guarantees\n\n**Opening scene:** Alex is asked to assess tenant isolation guarantees before an external review.\n**Rising action:** Alex inspects the trust contract and verification artifacts rather than chasing tribal knowledge.\n**Climax:** The evidence shows invariants enforced at unavoidable choke points, with contract tests that can be executed in CI.\n**Resolution:** Alex can approve the baseline as a credible control, because the guarantees are explicit and verifiable, not implied.\n\n### 5) API/integration contributor extending or adapting the core\n\n**Opening scene:** Sam wants to create an adapter for a different stack while keeping the core intact.\n**Rising action:** Sam reviews the constraints and sees where extensions are allowed versus where invariants are non-negotiable.\n**Climax:** The adapter integrates through the sanctioned boundary and inherits the same guarantees without widening the core API.\n**Resolution:** The extension adds reach without fragmenting the baseline, and the core remains intentionally small.\n\n### 6) New engineer onboarding into an existing system (acceptance signal)\n\n**Opening scene:** Riley joins an existing team mid-project.\n**Rising action:** Riley reads the baseline code and its contract tests rather than relying on oral history.\n**Climax:** A constrained operation makes the rules explicit, and the correct pattern is discoverable in code.\n**Resolution:** Onboarding requires fewer explanations, which acts as an acceptance signal that the baseline is doing its job.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- A single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context.\n- Explicit tenant attribution required before operations proceed.\n- Controlled, auditable elevation paths for privileged actions.\n- A clear, inspectable trust contract with runnable verification tests.\n- An extension model that preserves invariants and keeps the core small.\n- Baseline conventions are discoverable in code, not tribal knowledge.\n\n## Developer Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTenantSaas is a developer-facing foundation package for .NET-first multi-tenant systems, with a secondary npm distribution. It is embedded into existing systems as a baseline, not a standalone product.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- The core package must be minimal, invariant-driven, and safe by default.\n- A single, unavoidable integration point anchors tenant context for request paths and background execution.\n- Verification artifacts (contract tests) are part of the core deliverable and runnable by adopters.\n\n### Language Support (Language Matrix)\n\n- **MVP support:** .NET\n- **Secondary distribution:** npm package (for complementary tooling or examples)\n- **Out of scope for MVP:** other runtimes/languages\n\n### Installation Methods\n\n- **NuGet** as the primary installation path.\n- **npm** for any supporting tooling or integration snippets.\n- No IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n\n### API Surface\n\n- Small, stable API surface focused on tenant context, invariants, and verification hooks.\n- Avoid extension points that bypass invariants or widen core behavior.\n- Explicit refusal paths for ambiguous attribution or privileged actions.\n\n### Documentation & Guides (Required for MVP)\n\n- Concise conceptual model.\n- Explicit trust contract.\n- Minimal integration guide.\n- Runnable verification/contract tests guide.\n- Small API reference (focused on the core surface only).\n\n### Code Examples\n\n- One minimal sample project.\n- Copy-paste integration snippets.\n- No full reference application for MVP.\n\n### Migration Guide\n\n- MVP: no migration guide required (greenfield-first baseline).\n- Future: add a migration guide if adopting into existing systems becomes a primary use case.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Baseline must be hard to remove once integrated, without adding operational friction.\n- Contract tests should be easily wired into CI with minimal configuration.\n- Keep documentation crisp and enforce the mental model over feature descriptions.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Problem-solving MVP (prove guarantees are real and usable), with platform discipline for extensibility.\n**Resource Requirements:** 1 person with strong backend/systems thinking, multi-tenant architecture expertise, API/contract design, test rigor, and clear technical writing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Platform engineer integrating into a new service\n- Founder/early builder starting a project\n- Security/compliance reviewer inspecting guarantees\n- Contributor reading/extending the core (design-level)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Explicit baseline model (tenancy, shared system, scope)\n- One unavoidable integration point\n- Enforced invariants (small, non-negotiable)\n- Verification mechanism (contract tests or equivalent)\n- Clear non-goals and refusal behavior\n- Minimal sample + integration snippets\n- Conceptual + contract documentation\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- On-call incident workflows (documented, not deeply supported)\n- New-hire onboarding narratives\n- Advanced ops/support tooling\n- Additional adapters or helpers\n- Observability hooks\n- More ergonomic APIs\n- Extended examples (jobs, reporting, admin)\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Reference app\n- Ecosystem packages and optional extensions\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Guarantees too weak to matter or too rigid to use. Mitigate by keeping invariants minimal, validating in at least one real integration, and treating escape hatches as design failures unless explicitly justified.\n**Market Risks:** Misinterpreted as just another library or too abstract. Mitigate by leading with problem framing, stating non-goals clearly, and anchoring messaging on baseline/foundation rather than productivity.\n**Resource Risks:** Over-engineering and drifting into framework territory. Mitigate by freezing scope, requiring a new invariant for any new capability, and deleting ideas rather than deferring them.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Tenant Context & Baseline Model\n\n- FR1: Platform engineers can define the canonical tenant identity model used across the system.\n- FR2: The system can represent tenant scope and shared-system scope as explicit, distinct contexts.\n- FR3: The system can represent a no tenant state only when explicitly justified by the trust contract.\n- FR4: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.\n- FR5: The baseline model can be referenced as a single source of truth by services integrating it.\n\n### Invariant Enforcement & Refusal Behavior\n\n- FR6: The system can refuse operations with ambiguous or missing tenant attribution.\n- FR7: The system can enforce a small, non-negotiable invariant set defined by the trust contract.\n- FR8: Invariant enforcement applies uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths.\n- FR9: The system can surface refusal reasons explicitly to developers when invariants are violated.\n- FR10: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent and cannot proceed silently.\n\n### Integration Point & Context Propagation\n\n- FR11: The system provides a single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context initialization.\n- FR12: The integration point can propagate tenant context to downstream operations consistently.\n- FR13: The integration point can reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent.\n- FR14: Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold.\n\n### Verification & Contract Tests\n\n- FR15: The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement.\n- FR16: Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence.\n- FR17: Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package.\n- FR18: Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts.\n\n### Documentation & Trust Contract\n\n- FR19: The system provides a concise conceptual model describing tenancy, scope, and shared-system context.\n- FR20: The system provides an explicit trust contract that defines invariants and refusal behavior.\n- FR21: The system provides a minimal integration guide that shows the single integration point and required steps.\n- FR22: The system provides a verification guide that explains how to run and interpret contract tests.\n- FR23: The system provides a small API reference limited to the core surface area.\n\n### Extensibility & Adapter Boundaries\n\n- FR24: The system defines explicit boundaries where extensions may be built without weakening invariants.\n- FR25: Adapters can integrate through sanctioned boundaries while preserving the trust contract.\n- FR26: The core surface resists ad-hoc extension paths that would bypass enforcement.\n\n### Developer Onboarding & Discoverability (Acceptance Signals Only)\n\n- FR27: New engineers can discover the baseline rules from code and verification artifacts without tribal knowledge.\n- FR28: The baseline’s refusal behavior makes correct patterns discoverable through normal development flow.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Security\n\n- The system refuses ambiguous or unattributed operations by default.\n- Privileged or cross-scope actions require explicit declaration and justification.\n- No silent fallback behavior is permitted when required context is missing.\n- Security-relevant behavior is inspectable via code and tests, not configuration alone.\n\n### Reliability\n\n- Invariant enforcement behaves deterministically across execution paths.\n- Failure modes are explicit, local, and actionable (no partial success).\n- The system fails fast rather than degrading into unsafe behavior.\n- Core guarantees do not depend on runtime ordering, timing, or environment quirks.\n\n### Integration\n\n- The baseline integrates through a small, well-defined, unavoidable entry point.\n- Integration does not require adopting a framework, hosting model, or domain structure.\n- Integration is possible without modifying application business logic.\n- Removal or bypass of the integration point is detectable.\n\n### Performance\n\n- The core introduces no unbounded runtime overhead.\n- Enforcement checks are constant-time relative to request or operation scope.\n- No background polling, global locks, or centralized runtime dependencies are allowed.\n\n### Scalability\n\n- Guarantees hold regardless of application size or number of tenants.\n- The model does not assume a single service, database, or deployment topology.\n- Scaling does not require weakening or disabling core invariants.\n\n### Accessibility\n\n- Not applicable. TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
