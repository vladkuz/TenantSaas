You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"}}}

Uses adversarial review approach to find gaps and issues.'\nweb_bundle: false\n---\n\n# Implementation Readiness\n\n**Goal:** Validate that PRD, Architecture, Epics and Stories are complete and aligned before Phase 4 implementation starts, with a focus on ensuring epics and stories are logical and have accounted for all requirements and planning.\n\n**Your Role:** You are an expert Product Manager and Scrum Master, renowned and respected in the field of requirements traceability and spotting gaps in planning. Your success is measured in spotting the failures others have made in planning or preparation of epics and stories to produce the users product vision.\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step of the overall goal is a self contained instruction file that you will adhere too 1 file as directed at a time\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only 1 current step file will be loaded, read, and executed to completion - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Module Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`\n- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nLoad, read the full file and then execute `./step-01-document-discovery.md` to begin the workflow.\n"}}

Initialize Document Discovery\n\n\"Beginning **Document Discovery** to inventory all project files.\n\nI will:\n\n1. Search for all required documents (PRD, Architecture, Epics, UX)\n2. Group sharded documents together\n3. Identify any duplicates (whole + sharded versions)\n4. Present findings for your confirmation\"\n\n### 2. Document Search Patterns\n\nSearch for each document type using these patterns:\n\n#### A. PRD Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### B. Architecture Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### C. Epics & Stories Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### D. UX Design Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/index.md` and related files\n\n### 3. Organize Findings\n\nFor each document type found:\n\n```\n## [Document Type] Files Found\n\n**Whole Documents:**\n- [filename.md] ([size], [modified date])\n\n**Sharded Documents:**\n- Folder: [foldername]/\n  - index.md\n  - [other files in folder]\n```\n\n### 4. Identify Critical Issues\n\n#### Duplicates (CRITICAL)\n\nIf both whole and sharded versions exist:\n\n```\n⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: Duplicate document formats found\n- PRD exists as both whole.md AND prd/ folder\n- YOU MUST choose which version to use\n- Remove or rename the other version to avoid confusion\n```\n\n#### Missing Documents (WARNING)\n\nIf required documents not found:\n\n```\n⚠️ WARNING: Required document not found\n- Architecture document not found\n- Will impact assessment completeness\n```\n\n### 5. Add Initial Report Section\n\nInitialize {outputFile} with {templateFile}.\n\n### 6. Present Findings and Get Confirmation\n\nDisplay findings and ask:\n\"**Document Discovery Complete**\n\n[Show organized file list]\n\n**Issues Found:**\n\n- [List any duplicates requiring resolution]\n- [List any missing documents]\n\n**Required Actions:**\n\n- If duplicates exist: Please remove/rename one version\n- Confirm which documents to use for assessment\n\n**Ready to proceed?** [C] Continue after resolving issues\"\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: **Select an Option:** [C] Continue to File Validation\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed with 'C' selection\n- If duplicates identified, insist on resolution first\n- User can clarify file locations or request additional searches\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Save document inventory to {outputFile}, update frontmatter with completed step and files being included, and only then load read fully and execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then redisplay menu\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN C is selected and document inventory is saved will you load {nextStepFile} to begin file validation.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All document types searched systematically\n- Files organized and inventoried clearly\n- Duplicates identified and flagged for resolution\n- User confirmed file selections\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not searching all document types\n- Ignoring duplicate document conflicts\n- Proceeding without resolving critical issues\n- Not saving document inventory\n\n**Master Rule:** Clear file identification is essential for accurate assessment.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Initialize PRD Analysis\n\n\"Beginning **PRD Analysis** to extract all requirements.\n\nI will:\n\n1. Load the PRD document (whole or sharded)\n2. Read it completely and thoroughly\n3. Extract ALL Functional Requirements (FRs)\n4. Extract ALL Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n5. Document findings for coverage validation\"\n\n### 2. Load and Read PRD\n\nFrom the document inventory in step 1:\n\n- If whole PRD file exists: Load and read it completely\n- If sharded PRD exists: Load and read ALL files in the PRD folder\n- Ensure complete coverage - no files skipped\n\n### 3. Extract Functional Requirements (FRs)\n\nSearch for and extract:\n\n- Numbered FRs (FR1, FR2, FR3, etc.)\n- Requirements labeled \"Functional Requirement\"\n- User stories or use cases that represent functional needs\n- Business rules that must be implemented\n\nFormat findings as:\n\n```\n## Functional Requirements Extracted\n\nFR1: [Complete requirement text]\nFR2: [Complete requirement text]\nFR3: [Complete requirement text]\n...\nTotal FRs: [count]\n```\n\n### 4. Extract Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n\nSearch for and extract:\n\n- Performance requirements (response times, throughput)\n- Security requirements (authentication, encryption, etc.)\n- Usability requirements (accessibility, ease of use)\n- Reliability requirements (uptime, error rates)\n- Scalability requirements (concurrent users, data growth)\n- Compliance requirements (standards, regulations)\n\nFormat findings as:\n\n```\n## Non-Functional Requirements Extracted\n\nNFR1: [Performance requirement]\nNFR2: [Security requirement]\nNFR3: [Usability requirement]\n...\nTotal NFRs: [count]\n```\n\n### 5. Document Additional Requirements\n\nLook for:\n\n- Constraints or assumptions\n- Technical requirements not labeled as FR/NFR\n- Business constraints\n- Integration requirements\n\n### 6. Add to Assessment Report\n\nAppend to {outputFile}:\n\n```markdown\n## PRD Analysis\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n[Complete FR list from section 3]\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n[Complete NFR list from section 4]\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n[Any other requirements or constraints found]\n\n### PRD Completeness Assessment\n\n[Initial assessment of PRD completeness and clarity]\n```\n\n### 7. Auto-Proceed to Next Step\n\nAfter PRD analysis complete, immediately load next step for epic coverage validation.\n\n## PROCEEDING TO EPIC COVERAGE VALIDATION\n\nPRD analysis complete. Loading next step to validate epic coverage.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- PRD loaded and read completely\n- All FRs extracted with full text\n- All NFRs identified and documented\n- Findings added to assessment report\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not reading complete PRD (especially sharded versions)\n- Missing requirements in extraction\n- Summarizing instead of extracting full text\n- Not documenting findings in report\n\n**Master Rule:** Complete requirement extraction is essential for traceability validation.\n"}}

It targets platform engineers, founders, and security reviewers who need explicit, verifiable guarantees rather than framework-driven scaffolding. Differentiation comes from invariant-first design, explicit refusal behavior, and runnable contract tests that prove guarantees hold across execution paths.\n\n**Problem Statement:** Multi-tenant systems routinely allow actions with ambiguous tenant scope or authority, creating latent cross-tenant risks that are only discovered after incidents.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\nThe primary \"aha\" is a posture shift: teams stop debating multi-tenant assumptions because the baseline makes them obvious.\n\nPrimary signals:\n- New services/features fit cleanly into the baseline without redesign.\n- Developers hit constraints early and think \"good - this would have been messy later.\"\n- The trust contract is treated as the default, not a suggestion.\n\nSecondary signals:\n- Dangerous operations are surfaced explicitly instead of silently allowed.\n- New engineers can learn tenancy from code, not Slack history.\n\n**Metrics (6 months):**\n- >=3 new services integrate TenantSaas within 2 sprints of project start.\n- >=80% of new multi-tenant features ship without baseline redesign.\n- >=90% of services keep the baseline enabled after initial adoption.\n- New engineer onboarding to tenancy concepts takes <=1 day using docs + contract tests.\n\n### Business Success\n\n**~3 months (validation):**\n- Integrated into >=3 real (non-demo) projects.\n- >=50% of integrations happen at project start (greenfield).\n- >=70% of adopters keep it after initial experimentation.\n- >=3 feedback items explicitly reference it as a \"baseline\" or \"foundation.\"\n- >=2 internal docs or architecture notes cite it.\nValidation: the right users take it seriously and keep it.\n\n**~12 months (traction):**\n- Repeat usage by >=2 teams across >=2 projects each.\n- Annual retention >=80% among adopters.\n- >=3 external or internal mentions in blogs, architecture forums, or platform standards.\n- >=5 pull-through requests for examples/extensions/integrations (not core expansion).\n- >=2 teams describe it as infrastructure they would not remove without concern.\nValidation: it is treated as infrastructure, not a trial tool.\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Core invariants are enforced through unavoidable integration points.\n- Ambiguous or unattributed operations are refused by default.\n- Contract/verification tests exist, are runnable by adopters, and are executed in CI.\n- The core API surface stays small, stable, and resists ad-hoc extension.\n- Behavior is consistent across request paths, background execution, and admin/scripted usage.\nTechnical success = guarantees hold even as usage patterns expand.\n\n**Metrics (technical):**\n- 100% of defined invariants are enforced by contract tests across request, background, and admin paths.\n- Contract test suite runs in CI in <=10 minutes on reference projects.\n- Zero P0/P1 incidents caused by tenant-scope violations in adopter projects during first 6 months.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Multiple real projects integrate TenantSaas, with at least some greenfield starts.\n- Retention after initial experimentation (kept in place).\n- Documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- Contract tests running in CI across adopters.\n- Repeat adoption across projects by the same teams.\n\n**Metrics (measurable outcomes):**\n- >=3 real integrations, with >=1 greenfield.\n- >=70% retention after initial experimentation.\n- >=2 documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- >=2 adopters running contract tests in CI.\n- >=2 repeat adoptions by the same team/org.\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Explicit baseline model for multi-tenant SaaS.\n- One or more enforced invariants that remove ambiguity early.\n- A single unavoidable integration point anchoring the baseline.\n- Verification mechanism (tests/assertions) that proves rules hold.\n- Documentation that explains the model and contract (not features).\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Optional extensions/adapters.\n- Reference implementations or example apps.\n- Additional verification/reporting hooks.\n- Integration patterns for common tooling.\n- Better ergonomics around configuration and visibility.\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Recognized baseline for serious multi-tenant systems.\n- Core remains small and conservative.\n- Innovation primarily in extensions/examples/ecosystem contributions.\n- Shapes how teams think about SaaS foundations, not just scaffolding.\n- Referenced as a trust kernel, not marketed as a framework.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### 1) Platform engineer integrating TenantSaas into a new service\n\n**Opening scene:** Maya owns platform standards and is starting a new service in a growing SaaS stack. She is wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.\n**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.\n**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution. It forces a decision at design time, not after launch.\n**Resolution:** Maya adopts the trust contract as a shared team standard. The new service fits into existing architecture without special cases, and future services reuse the same baseline without re-debate.\n\n### 2) On-call responder using elevated scope during an incident (edge case)\n\n**Opening scene:** Jordan is on call when a cross-tenant data correction is required under time pressure.\n**Rising action:** Jordan attempts a privileged operation; the system requires explicit scope elevation with clear intent, not silent admin access.\n**Climax:** The system allows the operation only through a constrained path that is visible and auditable, avoiding accidental overreach.\n**Resolution:** The fix is applied quickly without bypassing the baseline. The incident is resolved and the audit trail is clean, with no special exceptions introduced.\n\n### 3) Founder / early builder adopting at project start\n\n**Opening scene:** Priya is starting a new SaaS product and wants to avoid fixing multi-tenancy later.\n**Rising action:** She adds TenantSaas early because it is small, explicit, and does not prescribe a full framework.\n**Climax:** The baseline forces clarity around tenant context at the first integration point, and Priya realizes she does not need to invent her own conventions.\n**Resolution:** The team moves fast with confidence, knowing the core assumptions are locked in without slowing momentum.\n\n### 4) Security/compliance stakeholder reviewing guarantees\n\n**Opening scene:** Alex is asked to assess tenant isolation guarantees before an external review.\n**Rising action:** Alex inspects the trust contract and verification artifacts rather than chasing tribal knowledge.\n**Climax:** The evidence shows invariants enforced at unavoidable choke points, with contract tests that can be executed in CI.\n**Resolution:** Alex can approve the baseline as a credible control, because the guarantees are explicit and verifiable, not implied.\n\n### 5) API/integration contributor extending or adapting the core\n\n**Opening scene:** Sam wants to create an adapter for a different stack while keeping the core intact.\n**Rising action:** Sam reviews the constraints and sees where extensions are allowed versus where invariants are non-negotiable.\n**Climax:** The adapter integrates through the sanctioned boundary and inherits the same guarantees without widening the core API.\n**Resolution:** The extension adds reach without fragmenting the baseline, and the core remains intentionally small.\n\n### 6) New engineer onboarding into an existing system (acceptance signal)\n\n**Opening scene:** Riley joins an existing team mid-project.\n**Rising action:** Riley reads the baseline code and its contract tests rather than relying on oral history.\n**Climax:** A constrained operation makes the rules explicit, and the correct pattern is discoverable in code.\n**Resolution:** Onboarding requires fewer explanations, which acts as an acceptance signal that the baseline is doing its job.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- A single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context.\n- Explicit tenant attribution required before operations proceed.\n- Controlled, auditable elevation paths for privileged actions.\n- A clear, inspectable trust contract with runnable verification tests.\n- An extension model that preserves invariants and keeps the core small.\n- Baseline conventions are discoverable in code, not tribal knowledge.\n\n## Developer Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTenantSaas is a developer-facing foundation package for .NET-first multi-tenant systems, with a secondary npm distribution. It is embedded into existing systems as a baseline, not a standalone product.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- The core package must be minimal, invariant-driven, and safe by default.\n- A single, unavoidable integration point anchors tenant context for request paths and background execution.\n- Verification artifacts (contract tests) are part of the core deliverable and runnable by adopters.\n\n### Language Support (Language Matrix)\n\n- **MVP support:** .NET\n- **Secondary distribution:** npm package (for complementary tooling or examples)\n- **Out of scope for MVP:** other runtimes/languages\n\n### Installation Methods\n\n- **NuGet** as the primary installation path.\n- **npm** for any supporting tooling or integration snippets.\n- No IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n\n### API Surface\n\n- Small, stable API surface focused on tenant context, invariants, and verification hooks.\n- Avoid extension points that bypass invariants or widen core behavior.\n- Explicit refusal paths for ambiguous attribution or privileged actions.\n\n### Documentation & Guides (Required for MVP)\n\n- Concise conceptual model.\n- Explicit trust contract.\n- Minimal integration guide.\n- Runnable verification/contract tests guide.\n- Small API reference (focused on the core surface only).\n\n### Code Examples\n\n- One minimal sample project.\n- Copy-paste integration snippets.\n- No full reference application for MVP.\n\n### Migration Guide\n\n- MVP: no migration guide required (greenfield-first baseline).\n- Future: add a migration guide if adopting into existing systems becomes a primary use case.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Baseline must be hard to remove once integrated, without adding operational friction.\n- Contract tests should be easily wired into CI with minimal configuration.\n- Keep documentation crisp and enforce the mental model over feature descriptions.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Problem-solving MVP (prove guarantees are real and usable), with platform discipline for extensibility.\n**Resource Requirements:** 1 person with strong backend/systems thinking, multi-tenant architecture expertise, API/contract design, test rigor, and clear technical writing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Platform engineer integrating into a new service\n- Founder/early builder starting a project\n- Security/compliance reviewer inspecting guarantees\n- Contributor reading/extending the core (design-level)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Explicit baseline model (tenancy, shared system, scope)\n- One unavoidable integration point\n- Enforced invariants (small, non-negotiable)\n- Verification mechanism (contract tests or equivalent)\n- Clear non-goals and refusal behavior\n- Minimal sample + integration snippets\n- Conceptual + contract documentation\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- On-call incident workflows (documented, not deeply supported)\n- New-hire onboarding narratives\n- Advanced ops/support tooling\n- Additional adapters or helpers\n- Observability hooks\n- More ergonomic APIs\n- Extended examples (jobs, reporting, admin)\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Reference app\n- Ecosystem packages and optional extensions\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Guarantees too weak to matter or too rigid to use. Mitigate by keeping invariants minimal, validating in at least one real integration, and treating escape hatches as design failures unless explicitly justified.\n**Market Risks:** Misinterpreted as just another library or too abstract. Mitigate by leading with problem framing, stating non-goals clearly, and anchoring messaging on baseline/foundation rather than productivity.\n**Resource Risks:** Over-engineering and drifting into framework territory. Mitigate by freezing scope, requiring a new invariant for any new capability, and deleting ideas rather than deferring them.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Tenant Context & Baseline Model\n\n-

fail in CI with a specific error within a single test run.\n\n### Performance\n\n- Baseline overhead shall add <=1ms at p95 per request in a reference benchmark of 10,000 requests.\n- Enforcement checks shall add <=5% latency when tenant count scales from 1 to 10,000, measured by benchmark.\n- The baseline shall start zero background polling loops or timers by default, verified by runtime

Requirements\n+\n+## Functional Requirements Extracted\n+\n+FR1: Platform engineers can define the canonical tenant identity model used across the system.\n+FR2: The system can represent tenant scope and shared-system scope as explicit, distinct contexts.\n+FR3: The system can represent a no tenant state only when explicitly justified by the trust contract.\n+FR4: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.\n+FR5: The baseline model can be referenced as a single source of truth by services integrating it.\n+FR6: The system can refuse operations with ambiguous or missing tenant attribution.\n+FR7: The system can enforce an explicit invariant set of <=7 invariants defined and enumerated in the trust contract.\n+FR8: Invariant enforcement applies uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths.\n+FR9: The system can surface refusal reasons explicitly to developers when invariants are violated.\n+FR10: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent and cannot proceed silently.\n+FR11: The system provides a single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context initialization.\n+FR12: The integration point can propagate tenant context to downstream operations consistently.\n+FR13: The integration point can reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent.\n+FR14: Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold.\n+FR15: The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement.\n+FR16: Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence.\n+FR17: Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package.\n+FR18: Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts.\n+FR19: The system provides a conceptual model describing tenancy, scope, and shared-system context in <=800 words or <=2 pages.\n+FR20: The system provides an explicit trust contract that defines invariants and refusal behavior.\n+FR21: The system provides an integration guide with <=6 required steps and a reference setup time <=30 minutes.\n+FR22: The system provides a verification guide that explains how to run and interpret contract tests.\n+FR23: The system provides an API reference that covers 100% of public surface area and lists all public types/entry points.\n+FR24: The system defines explicit boundaries where extensions may be built without weakening invariants.\n+FR25: Adapters can integrate through sanctioned boundaries while preserving the trust contract.\n+FR26: The core surface blocks bypass paths by restricting entry points to sanctioned boundaries, verified by contract tests covering 100% of public entry points.\n+FR27: New engineers can locate the trust contract and run contract tests within 60 minutes using the docs alone.\n+FR28: 100% of refusal errors include actionable guidance and a link to the relevant contract rule, verified by contract tests.\n+Total FRs: 28\n+\n+### Non-Functional Requirements\n+\n+## Non-Functional Requirements Extracted\n+\n+NFR1: The system shall reject 100% of operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution as measured by contract tests covering request, background, and admin paths.\n+NFR2: Privileged or cross-scope actions shall require explicit scope declaration and justification fields, verified by contract tests for all privileged operations.\n+NFR3: The system shall produce zero silent fallbacks when required context is missing, verified by negative tests in CI.\n+NFR4: Security-relevant behavior shall be covered by contract tests with >=90% branch coverage in the enforcement module, measured in CI.\n+NFR5: Invariant enforcement shall be deterministic across 10 repeated CI runs with identical inputs yielding identical outcomes (0 variance).\n+NFR6: Failure modes shall return explicit error codes/messages for 100% of invariant violations, verified by contract tests.\n+NFR7: Invariant check failures shall return within <=100ms at p95 in reference benchmarks.\n+NFR8: Core guarantees shall pass the same contract tests across local and CI environments with 0 environment-specific skips.\n+NFR9: All request paths shall pass through the single integration point in the reference project, verified by tracing tests with 100% coverage.\n+NFR10: Integration shall require no changes to domain/business logic in the reference project (0 files under domain namespaces modified), verified by sample diff.\n+NFR11: The integration guide shall include a full wiring example and complete successfully in <=30 minutes for a new service, measured in onboarding trials.\n+NFR12: If the integration point is removed or bypassed, contract tests shall fail in CI with a specific error within a single test run.\n+NFR13: Baseline overhead shall add <=1ms at p95 per request in a reference benchmark of 10,000 requests.\n+NFR14: Enforcement checks shall add <=5% latency when tenant count scales from 1 to 10,000, measured by benchmark.\n+NFR15: The baseline shall start zero background polling loops or timers by default, verified by runtime inspection tests.\n+NFR16: Contract tests shall pass with tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000 in load simulations.\n+NFR17: Reference architecture shall demonstrate multi-service and multi-database topology without special casing, verified by documented example and integration test.\n+NFR18: All invariants shall remain enforced under 10x load compared to baseline, verified by load tests.\n+NFR19: Not applicable. TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.\n+Total NFRs: 19\n+\n+### Additional Requirements\n+\n+- MVP support is .NET only; secondary distribution is npm; other runtimes are out of scope for MVP.\n+- Installation via NuGet (primary) and npm (secondary); no IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n+- Documentation deliverables required: conceptual model, trust contract, minimal integration guide, verification guide, small API reference.\n+- Code examples required: one minimal sample project and copy-paste integration snippets; no full reference app for MVP.\n+- Migration guide not required for MVP (greenfield-first baseline).\n+- Baseline should be hard to remove once integrated and contract tests must be easy to wire into CI.\n+\n+### PRD Completeness Assessment\n+\n+PRD is comprehensive with clearly enumerated FRs and NFRs plus concrete constraints and documentation deliverables. UX is explicitly out of scope, so omission is acceptable.\n*** End Patch"}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

requirements from the PRD, UX Design if it exists, and Architecture requirements into implementable stories.\n\n## Requirements Inventory\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nFR1: Platform engineers can define the canonical tenant identity model used across the system.\nFR2: The system can represent tenant scope and shared-system scope as explicit, distinct contexts.\nFR3: The system can represent a no tenant state only when explicitly justified by the trust contract.\nFR4: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.\nFR5: The baseline model can be referenced as a single source of truth by services integrating it.\nFR6: The system can refuse operations with ambiguous or missing tenant attribution.\nFR7: The system can enforce an explicit invariant set of <=7 invariants defined and enumerated in the trust contract.\nFR8: Invariant enforcement applies uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths.\nFR9: The system can surface refusal reasons explicitly to developers when invariants are violated.\nFR10: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent and cannot proceed silently.\nFR11: The system provides a single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context initialization.\nFR12: The integration point can propagate tenant context to downstream operations consistently.\nFR13: The integration point can reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent.\nFR14: Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold.\nFR15: The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement.\nFR16: Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence.\nFR17: Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package.\nFR18: Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts.\nFR19: The system provides a conceptual model describing tenancy, scope, and shared-system context in <=800 words or <=2 pages.\nFR20: The system provides an explicit trust contract that defines invariants and refusal behavior.\nFR21: The system provides an integration guide with <=6 required steps and a reference setup time <=30 minutes.\nFR22: The system provides a verification guide that explains how to run and interpret contract tests.\nFR23: The system provides an API reference that covers 100% of public surface area and lists all public types/entry points.\nFR24: The system defines explicit boundaries where extensions may be built without weakening invariants.\nFR25: Adapters can integrate through sanctioned boundaries while preserving the trust contract.\nFR26: The core surface blocks bypass paths by restricting entry points to sanctioned boundaries, verified by contract tests covering 100% of public entry points.\nFR27: New engineers can locate the trust contract and run contract tests within 60 minutes using the docs alone.\nFR28: 100% of refusal errors include actionable guidance and a link to the relevant contract rule, verified by contract tests.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: The system shall reject 100% of operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution as measured by contract tests covering request, background, and admin paths.\nNFR2: Privileged or cross-scope actions shall require explicit scope declaration and justification fields, verified by contract tests for all privileged operations.\nNFR3: The system shall produce zero silent fallbacks when required context is missing, verified by negative tests in CI.\nNFR4: Security-relevant behavior shall be covered by contract tests with >=90% branch coverage in the enforcement module, measured in CI.\nNFR5: Invariant enforcement shall be deterministic across 10 repeated CI runs with identical inputs yielding identical outcomes (0 variance).\nNFR6: Failure modes shall return explicit error codes/messages for 100% of invariant violations, verified by contract tests.\nNFR7: Invariant check failures shall return within <=100ms at p95 in reference benchmarks.\nNFR8: Core guarantees shall pass the same contract tests across local and CI environments with 0 environment-specific skips.\nNFR9: All request paths shall pass through the single integration point in the reference project, verified by tracing tests with 100% coverage.\nNFR10: Integration shall require no changes to domain/business logic in the reference project (0 files under domain namespaces modified), verified by sample diff.\nNFR11: The integration guide shall include a full wiring example and complete successfully in <=30 minutes for a new service, measured in onboarding trials.\nNFR12: If the integration point is removed or bypassed, contract tests shall fail in CI with a specific error within a single test run.\nNFR13: Baseline overhead shall add <=1ms at p95 per request in a reference benchmark of 10,000 requests.\nNFR14: Enforcement checks shall add <=5% latency when tenant count scales from 1 to 10,000, measured by benchmark.\nNFR15: The baseline shall start zero background polling loops or timers by default, verified by runtime inspection tests.\nNFR16: Contract tests shall pass with tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000 in load simulations.\nNFR17: Reference architecture shall demonstrate multi-service and multi-database topology without special casing, verified by documented example and integration test.\nNFR18: All invariants shall remain enforced under 10x load compared to baseline, verified by load tests.\nNFR19: Not applicable. TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- Starter template required: .NET SDK default templates; first implementation story is initializing the monorepo via documented `dotnet new` commands.\n- .NET 10 target framework for all projects; monorepo with core, abstractions, EF Core adapter, contract tests, and sample host.\n- Core library must be storage-agnostic; EF Core adapter is reference-only.\n- REST Minimal APIs for sample host with Swagger docs; errors must be RFC 7807 Problem Details only.\n- BYO-auth stance; sample uses API key auth.\n- Structured logging required with specified fields; optional OpenTelemetry hooks in sample.\n- CI/CD via GitHub Actions build/test/pack; release on tags.\n- Dockerfile (and optional docker-compose) for sample host.\n- Naming, routing, error, logging, and date/time format conventions must be enforced and tested.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Establish the Trust Baseline in a New Service\nFR2: Epic

one.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the documented `dotnet new` commands\n**When** I execute them\n**Then** the solution and projects are created as specified in the architecture\n**And** all projects target `net10.0` in their `*.csproj` files\n**And** the solution builds successfully with `dotnet build`\n**And** the monorepo includes core, abstractions, EF Core adapter, contract tests, and sample host projects\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR14\n\n### Story 1.2: Define the Tenant Context Model & Scope Types\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want explicit tenant context and scope types with accessors,\nSo that operations attach tenant context consistently.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the abstractions project\n**When** I implement tenant context, scope types, and accessors\n**Then** the system can represent tenant scope, shared scope, and explicit “no tenant” states\n**And** the API surface is minimal and stable without framework coupling\n**And** attempts to create an invalid or ambiguous scope are rejected with a clear invariant code\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5\n\n### Story 1.3: Add the Unavoidable Integration Point (Request Middleware)\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a single request-path integration point that initializes tenant context,\nSo that every request is guaranteed to pass through it.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** an HTTP request to the sample host\n**When** the tenant context middleware runs\n**Then** a tenant context is required and attached before downstream handlers execute\n**And** requests without valid tenant context are refused with Problem Details and a stable invariant code\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR11, FR12, FR13\n\n### Story 1.4: Implement Invariant Enforcement + Refusal Reasons\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want invariant enforcement with explicit refusal reasons,\nSo that ambiguous or cross-tenant operations are blocked and explainable.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** an operation without required tenant attribution\n**When** the invariant enforcer runs\n**Then** the operation is refused\n**And** the refusal exposes a stable invariant code and clear reason\n**And** repeated runs with the same inputs yield identical outcomes\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10\n**NFRs implemented:** NFR1, NFR3, NFR6\n\n### Story 1.5: Add EF Core Reference Adapter (SaveChanges Guard)\n\nAs a platform engineer using EF Core,\nI want a reference adapter that enforces tenant scope in persistence,\nSo that cross-tenant writes are blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a DbContext configured with the adapter\n**When** SaveChanges is called without valid tenant context\n**Then** the operation is refused\n**And** the refusal follows the same invariant codes as core enforcement\n**And** the core library remains storage-agnostic with no EF Core dependency\n**And** valid tenant-scoped operations succeed without additional configuration\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR6, FR8\n\n### Story 1.6: Sample Host Wiring (Minimal API + Problem Details)\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a runnable sample host that demonstrates the baseline in practice,\nSo that I can see the integration flow end-to-end.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the sample host\n**When** I run it and hit example endpoints\n**Then** tenant context enforcement is active\n**And** the host uses Minimal APIs\n**And** errors return RFC 7807 Problem Details only\n**And** Problem Details include `trace_id` and `invariant_code` extensions when applicable\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR9, FR14\n\n### Story 1.7: Sample Host Swagger Documentation\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the sample host,\nSo that integration points are discoverable and consistent.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the sample host running locally\n**When** I open the Swagger UI or OpenAPI JSON\n**Then** all sample endpoints are documented\n**And** the error responses are described as Problem Details\n**And** undocumented endpoints are treated as a test failure\n\n### Story 1.8: Sample Host API Key Authentication (BYO-Auth)\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want the sample host to use a simple API key while documenting BYO-auth,\nSo that auth is runnable without imposing a framework.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a request without an API key\n**When** I call a sample endpoint\n**Then** the response is 401/403 using Problem Details\n**And** a valid API key allows the request to proceed\n**And** the docs state the BYO-auth stance and replacement guidance\n**And** invalid keys do not reveal whether a tenant exists\n\n### Story 1.9: Structured Logging + Optional OpenTelemetry Hooks\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want structured logging with required fields and optional OTel hooks,\nSo that enforcement events are traceable without logging lock-in.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a request processed by the sample host\n**When** I inspect log entries emitted by the baseline\n**Then** each log line includes required fields: `tenant_ref`, `trace_id`, `request_id`, `invariant_code`, `event_name`, `severity`\n**And** the logging helper does not require a specific logging stack beyond `ILogger`\n**And** optional OpenTelemetry hooks are demonstrated in the sample host\n**And** missing required fields fail a contract test\n\n### Story 1.10: Docker Assets for Sample Host\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want Docker assets for the sample host,\nSo that I can run and verify the baseline in containers.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the repository root\n**When** I build the sample host container\n**Then** a Dockerfile produces a runnable image\n**And** docker-compose (if provided) starts the sample host successfully\n**And** containerized runs emit the same Problem Details format as local runs\n\n## Epic 2: Contract Tests That Prove the Guarantees\n\nTeams can run verification tests in CI to prove invariants across request, background, admin, and scripted paths.\n\n### Story 2.1: Contract Test Harness & Fixtures\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a contract test harness with fixtures,\nSo that invariants can be executed consistently across contexts.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the contract tests project\n**When** I implement reusable fixtures for tenant context and test hosts\n**Then** contract tests can run deterministically across environments\n**And** fixtures cover request and non-request execution setup\n**And** fixture failures provide actionable diagnostics\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR15, FR17, FR18\n**NFRs implemented:** NFR5\n\n### Story 2.2: Invariant Enforcement Tests (Request Path)\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want contract tests that assert refusal behavior on request paths,\nSo that ambiguous or missing tenant context is always blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** an HTTP request without required tenant context\n**When** the request is processed through the integration point\n**Then** the invariant enforcement refuses the operation\n**And** the response returns a stable invariant code\n**And** ambiguous tenant attribution is refused with a distinct invariant code\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR15, FR16\n**NFRs implemented:** NFR1, NFR2, NFR6\n\n### Story 2.3: Invariant Enforcement Tests (Background/Admin Paths)\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want contract tests that validate background and admin execution paths,\nSo that invariants are enforced outside HTTP requests.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a background or admin operation without valid tenant context\n**When** the operation is executed through the invariant enforcer\n**Then** the operation is refused consistently\n**And** the same invariant codes and refusal reasons are emitted\n**And** privileged operations require explicit scope declaration and justification\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR15, FR18\n**NFRs implemented:** NFR1, NFR2, NFR3\n\n### Story 2.4: CI Execution of Contract Tests\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want contract tests running in CI with clear pass/fail signals,\nSo that adoption is verifiable.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a CI workflow\n**When** the contract test suite runs\n**Then** failures are reported clearly in CI output\n**And** the full suite completes within the target time budget\n**And** enforcement branch coverage meets the >=90% threshold\n**And** no environment-specific skips are permitted\n**And** failures include the invariant code or test name that triggered them\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR16, FR17\n**NFRs implemented:** NFR4, NFR8\n\n### Story 2.5: CI Build/Test/Pack and Release on Tags\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want GitHub Actions to build, test, and pack releases,\nSo that distribution is consistent and automated.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a push to main\n**When** the CI workflow runs\n**Then** it builds and tests all projects\n**And** it produces NuGet packages via `dotnet pack`\n**And** tagged releases trigger a publish step\n\n### Story 2.6: Performance and Determinism Benchmarks\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want baseline performance and determinism benchmarks,\nSo that overhead and timing guarantees are validated.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a reference benchmark suite\n**When** I run it locally or in CI\n**Then** invariant checks return within <=100ms at p95\n**And** baseline overhead adds <=1ms at p95 for 10,000 requests\n**And** enforcement checks add <=5% latency from 1 to 10,000 tenants\n**And** repeated runs yield identical outcomes (0 variance)\n**And** no background polling loops or timers start by default\n**And** results are published as part of CI artifacts\n\n**NFRs implemented:** NFR5, NFR7, NFR13, NFR14, NFR15\n\n### Story 2.7: Integration Path and Pattern Enforcement Tests\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want contract tests to enforce integration and pattern conventions,\nSo that all request paths are guarded and formats are consistent.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the reference project\n**When** I run the contract test suite\n**Then** every request path is verified to pass through the integration point\n**And** tests validate Problem Details shape, required log fields, plural route naming, explicit `{tenantId}` parameters, and date/time format\n**And** bypassing the integration point causes contract tests to fail in CI\n**And** the sample integration requires no domain/business logic changes\n**And** any deviation reports the specific offending endpoint or log field\n\n**NFRs implemented:** NFR9, NFR10, NFR12\n\n### Story 2.8: Scalability and Topology Validation\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want scalability and topology validation,\nSo that invariants hold under load and multi-service layouts.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** load simulations with tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000\n**When** the contract tests run\n**Then** invariants remain enforced under 10x load\n**And** the reference architecture demonstrates multi-service and multi-database topology\n**And** failed invariants include the tenant count and scenario in output\n\n**NFRs implemented:** NFR16, NFR17, NFR18\n\n### Story 2.9: Naming and Structure Convention Validation\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want automated checks for naming and structure conventions,\nSo that pattern violations are caught early.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the reference solution and EF Core model\n**When** convention validation checks run\n**Then** API routes are plural and use explicit `{tenantId}` parameters\n**And** database tables and columns follow PascalCase without underscores\n**And** the project structure matches the flat root layout without `src/` or `tests/` folders\n\n## Epic 3: Documentation & Trust Contract That Make Adoption Fast\n\nEngineers can understand the model, integrate quickly, and troubleshoot using explicit guidance, trust contract, and complete API reference.\n\n### Story 3.1: Trust Contract Document\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want an explicit trust contract document that defines invariants and refusal behavior,\nSo that guarantees are clear and auditable.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the documentation set\n**When** I open the trust contract\n**Then** all invariants are enumerated with explicit refusal behavior\n**And** each invariant has a stable code referenced by errors\n**And** any missing invariant code is treated as a documentation defect\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR20\n\n### Story 3.2: Conceptual Model (<=2 pages)\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a concise conceptual model of tenancy and scope,\nSo that I can understand the baseline quickly.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the conceptual model doc\n**When** I read it end-to-end\n**Then** it fits within two pages or 800 words\n**And** it explains tenant, shared, and no-tenant scopes clearly\n**And** examples avoid implementation detail beyond the defined model\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR19\n\n### Story 3.3: Integration Guide (<=6 steps, <=30 min)\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a minimal integration guide with clear steps,\nSo that I can integrate the baseline quickly.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the integration guide\n**When** I follow the steps in a new service\n**Then** the integration completes in six steps or fewer\n**And** a new engineer can finish within 30 minutes\n**And** steps that are skipped or out of order fail the contract tests\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR21\n**NFRs implemented:** NFR11\n\n### Story 3.4: Verification Guide (Contract Tests)\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a verification guide that explains contract tests,\nSo that I can run and interpret the guarantees.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the verification guide\n**When** I follow the instructions\n**Then** I can run the contract tests successfully\n**And** I can interpret failures using referenced invariant codes\n**And** at least one failing example is documented with remediation guidance\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR22\n\n### Story 3.5: API Reference (100% Surface Area)\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want a complete API reference for public types and entry points,\nSo that I can integrate without guesswork.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the public API surface\n**When** I compare it against the API reference\n**Then** all public types and entry points are documented\n**And** the reference matches current signatures\n**And** undocumented public members are treated as a release blocker\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR23\n\n### Story 3.6: Actionable Error Guidance\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want refusal errors to include actionable guidance and links to contract rules,\nSo that I can fix issues quickly.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a refusal error response\n**When** I inspect the error details\n**Then** it includes a stable invariant code and guidance text\n**And** it links to the relevant trust contract rule\n**And** missing links are reported in documentation validation\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR27, FR28\n\n## Epic 4: Extension Boundaries & Reference Adapter Patterns\n\nContributors can build adapters and extensions without weakening invariants, with bypass paths blocked and tested.\n\n### Story 4.1: Define Extension Boundaries & Contracts\n\nAs a contributor,\nI want explicit extension boundaries and contracts,\nSo that I can build adapters without weakening invariants.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the architecture and documentation\n**When** I review extension boundaries\n**Then** sanctioned extension points are explicitly defined\n**And** bypass paths are explicitly prohibited\n**And** prohibited extension attempts are documented with examples\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR24, FR26\n\n### Story 4.2: Adapter Guidance + Examples\n\nAs a contributor,\nI want guidance and examples for building adapters,\nSo that I can integrate new stacks safely.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the adapter guidance\n**When** I follow the example\n**Then** the adapter preserves invariant enforcement\n**And** it integrates through sanctioned boundaries only\n**And** a bypass attempt triggers a documented failure mode\n\n**FRs implemented:** FR25\n\n### Story 4.3: Bypass Prevention Validation\n\nAs a platform engineer,\nI want validation that bypass paths are blocked,\nSo that extensions cannot weaken the baseline.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a public entry point\n**When** I attempt to bypass invariants\n**Then** contract tests fail\n**And** the failure references the violated invariant code\n**And** the failure indicates the exact bypass mechanism used\n/new\n**FRs implemented:** FR26\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Initialize Best Practices Validation\n\n\"Beginning **Epic Quality Review** against create-epics-and-stories standards.\n\nI will rigorously validate:\n\n- Epics deliver user value (not technical milestones)\n- Epic independence (Epic 2 doesn't need Epic 3)\n- Story dependencies (no forward references)\n- Proper story sizing and completeness\n\nAny deviation from best practices will be flagged as a defect.\"\n\n### 2. Epic Structure Validation\n\n#### A. User Value Focus Check\n\nFor each epic:\n\n- **Epic Title:** Is it user-centric (what user can do)?\n- **Epic Goal:** Does it describe user outcome?\n- **Value Proposition:** Can users benefit from this epic alone?\n\n**Red flags (violations):**\n\n- \"Setup Database\" or \"Create Models\" - no user value\n- \"API Development\" - technical milestone\n- \"Infrastructure Setup\" - not user-facing\n- \"Authentication System\" - borderline (is it user value?)\n\n#### B. Epic Independence Validation\n\nTest epic independence:\n\n- **Epic 1:** Must stand alone completely\n- **Epic 2:** Can function using only Epic 1 output\n- **Epic 3:** Can function using Epic 1 & 2 outputs\n- **Rule:** Epic N cannot require Epic N+1 to work\n\n**Document failures:**\n\n- \"Epic 2 requires Epic 3 features to function\"\n- Stories in Epic 2 referencing Epic 3 components\n- Circular dependencies between epics\n\n### 3. Story Quality Assessment\n\n#### A. Story Sizing Validation\n\nCheck each story:\n\n- **Clear User Value:** Does the story deliver something meaningful?\n- **Independent:** Can it be completed without future stories?\n\n**Common violations:**\n\n- \"Setup all models\" - not a USER story\n- \"Create login UI (depends on Story 1.3)\" - forward dependency\n\n#### B. Acceptance Criteria Review\n\nFor each story's ACs:\n\n- **Given/When/Then Format:** Proper BDD structure?\n- **Testable:** Each AC can be verified independently?\n- **Complete:** Covers all scenarios including errors?\n- **Specific:** Clear expected outcomes?\n\n**Issues to find:**\n\n- Vague criteria like \"user can login\"\n- Missing error conditions\n- Incomplete happy path\n- Non-measurable outcomes\n\n### 4. Dependency Analysis\n\n#### A. Within-Epic Dependencies\n\nMap story dependencies within each epic:\n\n- Story 1.1 must be completable alone\n- Story 1.2 can use Story 1.1 output\n- Story 1.3 can use Story 1.1 & 1.2 outputs\n\n**Critical violations:**\n\n- \"This story depends on Story 1.4\"\n- \"Wait for future story to work\"\n- Stories referencing features not yet implemented\n\n#### B. Database/Entity Creation Timing\n\nValidate database creation approach:\n\n- **Wrong:** Epic 1 Story 1 creates all tables upfront\n- **Right:** Each story creates tables it needs\n- **Check:** Are tables created only when first needed?\n\n### 5. Special Implementation Checks\n\n#### A. Starter Template Requirement\n\nCheck if Architecture specifies starter template:\n\n- If YES: Epic 1 Story 1 must be \"Set up initial project from starter template\"\n- Verify story includes cloning, dependencies, initial configuration\n\n#### B. Greenfield vs Brownfield Indicators\n\nGreenfield projects should have:\n\n- Initial project setup story\n- Development environment configuration\n- CI/CD pipeline setup early\n\nBrownfield projects should have:\n\n- Integration points with existing systems\n- Migration or compatibility stories\n\n### 6. Best Practices Compliance Checklist\n\nFor each epic, verify:\n\n- [ ] Epic delivers user value\n- [ ] Epic can function independently\n- [ ] Stories appropriately sized\n- [ ] No forward dependencies\n- [ ] Database tables created when needed\n- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Traceability to FRs maintained\n\n### 7. Quality Assessment Documentation\n\nDocument all findings by severity:\n\n#### 🔴 Critical Violations\n\n- Technical epics with no user value\n- Forward dependencies breaking independence\n- Epic-sized stories that cannot be completed\n\n#### 🟠 Major Issues\n\n- Vague acceptance criteria\n- Stories requiring future stories\n- Database creation violations\n\n#### 🟡 Minor Concerns\n\n- Formatting inconsistencies\n- Minor structure deviations\n- Documentation gaps\n\n### 8. Autonomous Review Execution\n\nThis review runs autonomously to maintain standards:\n\n- Apply best practices without compromise\n- Document every violation with specific examples\n- Provide clear remediation guidance\n- Prepare recommendations for each issue\n\n## REVIEW COMPLETION:\n\nAfter completing epic quality review:\n\n- Update {outputFile} with all quality findings\n- Document specific best practices violations\n- Provide actionable recommendations\n- Load {nextStepFile} for final readiness assessment\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nThis step executes autonomously. Load {nextStepFile} only after complete epic quality review is documented.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All epics validated against best practices\n- Every dependency checked and verified\n- Quality violations documented with examples\n- Clear remediation guidance provided\n- No compromise on standards enforcement\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Accepting technical epics as valid\n- Ignoring forward dependencies\n- Not verifying story sizing\n- Overlooking obvious violations\n\n**Master Rule:** Enforce best practices rigorously. Find all violations.\n"}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

measured by contract tests covering request, background, and admin paths.\nNFR2: Privileged or cross-scope actions shall require explicit scope declaration and justification fields, verified by contract tests for all privileged operations.\nNFR3: The system shall produce zero silent fallbacks when required context is missing, verified by negative tests in CI.\nNFR4: Security-relevant behavior shall be covered by contract tests with >=90% branch coverage in the enforcement module, measured in CI.\nNFR5: Invariant enforcement shall be deterministic across 10 repeated CI runs with identical inputs yielding identical outcomes (0 variance).\nNFR6: Failure modes shall return explicit error codes/messages for 100% of invariant violations, verified by contract tests.\nNFR7: Invariant check failures shall return within <=100ms at p95 in reference benchmarks.\nNFR8: Core guarantees shall pass the same contract tests across local and CI environments with 0 environment-specific skips.\nNFR9: All request paths shall pass through the single integration point in the reference project, verified by tracing tests with 100% coverage.\nNFR10: Integration shall require no changes to domain/business logic in the reference project (0 files under domain namespaces modified), verified by sample diff.\nNFR11: The integration guide shall include a full wiring example and complete successfully in <=30 minutes for a new service, measured in onboarding trials.\nNFR12: If the integration point is removed or bypassed, contract tests shall fail in CI with a specific error within a single test run.\nNFR13: Baseline overhead shall add <=1ms at p95 per request in a reference benchmark of 10,000 requests.\nNFR14: Enforcement checks shall add <=5% latency when tenant count scales from 1 to 10,000, measured by benchmark.\nNFR15: The baseline shall start zero background polling loops or timers by default, verified by runtime inspection tests.\nNFR16: Contract tests shall pass with tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000 in load simulations.\nNFR17: Reference architecture shall demonstrate multi-service and multi-database topology without special casing, verified by documented example and integration test.\nNFR18: All invariants shall remain enforced under 10x load compared to baseline, verified by load tests.\nNFR19: Not applicable. TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.\nTotal NFRs: 19\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n- MVP support is .NET only; secondary distribution is npm; other runtimes are out of scope for MVP.\n- Installation via NuGet (primary) and npm (secondary); no IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n- Documentation deliverables required: conceptual model, trust contract, minimal integration guide, verification guide, small API reference.\n- Code examples required: one minimal sample project and copy-paste integration snippets; no full reference app for MVP.\n- Migration guide not required for MVP (greenfield-first baseline).\n- Baseline should be hard to remove once integrated and contract tests must be easy to wire into CI.\n\n### PRD Completeness Assessment\n\nPRD is comprehensive with clearly enumerated FRs and NFRs plus concrete constraints and documentation deliverables. UX is explicitly out of scope, so omission is acceptable.\n\n## Epic Coverage Validation\n\n## Epic FR Coverage Extracted\n\nFR1: Covered in Epic 1 - Establish the Trust Baseline in a New Service\nFR2: Covered in Epic 1 -

All PRD FRs are mapped to epics.\n\n### Coverage Statistics\n\n- Total PRD FRs: 28\n- FRs covered in epics: 28\n- Coverage percentage: 100%\n\n## UX Alignment Assessment\n\n### UX Document Status\n\nNot found.\n\n### Alignment Issues\n\nNone identified. PRD describes a developer-facing baseline with no end-user UI surface.\n\n### Warnings\n\nNone. UX is not implied for this project.\n\n## Epic Quality Review\n\n### 🔴 Critical Violations\n\nNone identified.\n\n### 🟠 Major Issues\n\n- Stories without explicit FR traceability: Epic 1 Stories 1.7–1.10; Epic 2 Stories 2.5–2.9. Recommendation: add `FRs implemented` for each story or explicitly mark as supporting work tied to specific FRs/NFRs.\n- Oversized stories bundling multiple independent outcomes: Story 2.6 combines benchmarks, determinism, latency targets, and CI artifact publishing; Story 2.7 bundles route validation, logging fields, Problem Details shape, and integration bypass tests. Recommendation: split into smaller stories aligned to a single outcome each.\n\n### 🟡 Minor Concerns\n\n- Greenfield setup guidance suggests early CI/CD configuration; the CI/CD story appears in Epic 2 rather than Epic 1. Recommendation: consider moving Story 2.5 earlier or explicitly note why it can wait.\n- Some stories emphasize tooling deliverables (e.g., Docker assets) without explicit error-path validation. Recommendation: add negative-case ACs where relevant.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- Add FR/NFR traceability to every story, including supporting infrastructure items.\n- Right-size large stories to reduce hidden dependencies and improve sequencing flexibility.\n\n## Summary and Recommendations\n\n### Overall Readiness Status\n\nNEEDS WORK\n\n### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action\n\n- Missing FR traceability on multiple stories (Epic 1 Stories 1.7–1.10; Epic 2 Stories 2.5–2.9).\n- Oversized stories that bundle multiple outcomes (Stories 2.6 and 2.7).\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. Add explicit FR/NFR mappings to all stories or document why a story is supporting work.\n2. Split Stories 2.6 and 2.7 into smaller, independently deliverable stories.\n3. Decide whether CI/CD setup belongs in Epic 1 for earlier greenfield readiness.\n\n### Final Note\n\nThis assessment identified 4 issues across 2 categories (major, minor). Address the critical issues before proceeding to implementation. These findings can be used to improve the artifacts or you may choose to proceed as-is.\n\n**Assessment Date:** 2026-01-25\n**Assessor:** John (Product Manager)\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Add negative-case acceptance criteria to tooling-related stories where applicable.\n@@\n ### Final Note\n \n-This assessment identified 4 issues across 2 categories (major, minor). Address the critical issues before proceeding to implementation. These findings can be used to improve the artifacts or you may choose to proceed as-is.\n+This assessment identified 2 minor issues.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
