You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Check for Existing Workflow\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n- Look for existing {planning_artifacts}/`*architecture*.md`\n- If exists, read the complete file(s) including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n- **STOP here** and load `./step-01b-continue.md` immediately\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle the continuation logic\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery. Documents can be in the following locations:\n- {planning_artifacts}/**\n- {output_folder}/**\n- {product_knowledge}/**\n- docs/**\n\nAlso - when searching - documents can be a single markdown file, or a folder with an index and multiple files. For Example, if searching for `*foo*.md` and not found, also search for a folder called *foo*/index.md (which indicates sharded content)\n\nTry to discover the following:\n- Product Brief (`*brief*.md`)\n- Product Requirements Document (`*prd*.md`)\n- UX Design (`*ux-design*.md`) and other\n- Research Documents (`*research*.md`)\n- Project Documentation (generally multiple documents might be found for this in the `{product_knowledge}` or `docs` folder.)\n- Project Context (`**/project-context.md`)\n\n<critical>Confirm what you have found with the user, along with asking if the user wants to provide anything else. Only after this confirmation will you proceed to follow the loading rules</critical>\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely that the user confirmed or provided (no offset/limit)\n- If there is a project context, whatever is relevant should try to be biased in the remainder of this whole workflow process\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture, using the index first to potentially know the potential of each document\n- index.md is a guide to what's relevant whenever available\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Validate Required Inputs\n\nBefore proceeding, verify we have the essential inputs:\n\n**PRD Validation:**\n\n- If no PRD found: \"Architecture requires a PRD to work from. Please run the PRD workflow first or provide the PRD file path.\"\n- Do NOT proceed without PRD\n\n**Other Input that might exist:**\n\n- UX Spec: \"Provides UI/UX architectural requirements\"\n\n#### C. Create Initial Document\n\nCopy the template from `{installed_path}/architecture-decision-template.md` to `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`\n\n#### D. Complete Initialization and Report\n\nComplete setup and report to user:\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\nReport what was found:\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your Architecture workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Documents Found:**\n\n- PRD: {number of PRD files loaded or \"None found - REQUIRED\"}\n- UX Design: {number of UX files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Research: {number of research files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project docs: {number of project files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project context: {project_context_rules count of rules for AI agents found}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\nReady to begin architectural decision making. Do you have any other documents you'd like me to include?\n\n[C] Continue to project context analysis\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing workflow detected and handed off to step-01b correctly\n✅ Fresh workflow initialized with template and frontmatter\n✅ Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n✅ All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n✅ PRD requirement validated and communicated\n✅ User confirmed document setup and can proceed\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n❌ Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n❌ Creating document without proper template\n❌ Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n❌ Not reporting what documents were found to user\n❌ Proceeding without validating PRD requirement\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects [C] to continue, only after ensuring all the template output has been created, then load `./step-02-context.md` to analyze the project context and begin architectural decision making.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-02 until user explicitly selects [C] from the menu and setup is confirmed!\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It addresses a systemic safety problem: teams routinely perform shared-system actions with ambiguous ownership, scope, or authority, which leads to irreversible trust failures. The product encodes trust as explicit invariants, enforced at unavoidable choke points, so unsafe actions fail immediately and clearly. The goal is to make it hard to build multi-tenant systems incorrectly-and impossible to do so quietly.\n\n---\n\n## Core Vision\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nMulti-tenant SaaS systems regularly allow actions whose tenant ownership, scope, or authority is implicit or ambiguous. This ambiguity produces latent, catastrophic failures-cross-tenant exposure, corrupted state, and unverifiable incident response-because enforcement depends on human discipline rather than mechanical guarantees.\n\n### Problem Impact\n\nWhen the first cross-tenant violation occurs, trust is permanently damaged. Teams face legal and compliance exposure, velocity drops under fear, and systems accrete defensive complexity instead of clarity. On-call engineers, senior platform owners, founders, and security reviewers bear the earliest and most intense consequences because they are closest to the blast radius.\n\n### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short\n\nMost frameworks and libraries optimize for multi-tenancy capabilities, not guarantees. Enforcement is partial and contextual (HTTP middleware but not jobs), tenant attribution is often optional or implicit, privilege is treated as a role rather than a scoped event, and proof is absent. This creates safety gaps exactly where incidents occur and produces false confidence that persists until failure.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nA trust-first foundation that requires explicit attribution, refuses ambiguous actions, enforces invariants at a small set of unavoidable choke points, and makes exceptional power explicit and reviewable. The system shifts multi-tenant safety from \"best practices\" to \"mechanically enforced guarantees.\"\n\n### Key Differentiators\n\n- Guarantees over capabilities: define what must never happen, then enforce it.\n- Invariant-first design with unavoidable enforcement boundaries.\n- Formal scope and privilege semantics; exceptional power is explicit and auditable.\n- Executable proof of correctness (e.g., contract tests), not narrative assurance.\n- Deliberately narrow surface area to preserve trust under stress.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n\n**Senior / Platform Engineers**  \nThey own system integrity over time and are accountable for failures caused by entropy, team growth, and inconsistent enforcement. They need mechanical guarantees, a shared mental model that scales across teams, and fewer ad-hoc exceptions to police. TenantSaas becomes a trust kernel and policy anchor they can standardize across services.\n\n**Founders & Early SaaS Builders**  \nThey move fast and cannot afford one existential trust failure. They need protection without cognitive overhead, early guardrails that don’t slow iteration, and confidence they didn’t miss something fundamental. TenantSaas lets them ship while eliminating silent risk.\n\n### Secondary Users\n\n**On-Call / Incident Responders**  \nThey act under pressure with elevated privileges. They need clear blast-radius boundaries, safe inspection/repair paths, and guardrails that prevent accidental escalation.\n\n**Security, Compliance, and Audit Stakeholders**  \nThey must validate guarantees that usually exist only as intent. They need inspectable controls, repeatable evidence, and clear answers to “how is this enforced?”\n\n**New Engineers / Maintainers**  \nThey inherit implicit rules. They need a system that teaches correct behavior through constraints and provides fast feedback when actions are unsafe.\n\n### User Journey\n\n**Founders / Early SaaS Builders**  \nDiscovery arises during multi-tenant design, near-misses, or enterprise readiness. Onboarding is fast and opinionated: explicit attribution is required, unsafe defaults fail loudly. Day-to-day, it runs mostly invisibly, with occasional explicit scoping or privilege justification. Success is often negative-a dangerous mistake is prevented. Long-term, it becomes baseline infrastructure and fades into the background.\n\n**Senior / Platform Engineers**  \nDiscovery follows incidents, inconsistent tenant handling, or org-wide standardization needs. Onboarding is deliberate: they inspect the trust contract, enforcement points, and contract tests, then adopt in high-risk areas first. Day-to-day, it serves as a policy anchor that constrains patterns and standardizes privilege handling. Success is governance that emerges without meetings-safe integration, contained incidents, and evidence-based audits. Long-term, it becomes part of platform standards and shapes new services by default.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nUser success is felt when TenantSaas fades into the background while making progress more reliable. Teams can model tenants, roles, and shared infrastructure without inventing new mental frameworks; early architectural decisions hold; growth is incremental rather than destabilizing; and the system remains understandable months later. The “worth it” moment is when teams realize they didn’t have to rethink multi-tenancy, rewrite core assumptions, or teach tribal rules to new engineers.\n\n### Business Objectives\n\n**~3 months (validation):**  \nValidate resonance with serious builders (platform engineers, committed founders), prove TenantSaas is understood as a baseline/substrate, build credibility through depth and restraint, and confirm adoption without immediate forking. Success = “the right people are paying attention and taking it seriously.”\n\n**~12 months (traction & positioning):**  \nEstablish TenantSaas as a reference baseline for multi-tenant SaaS architecture, keep it in place as systems grow, anchor governance and structure discussions, and pull follow-on extensions organically. Success = “this shaped how teams think about multi-tenant SaaS, not just how they scaffold it.”\n\n### Key Performance Indicators\n\n**Leading indicators (early, high-signal):**\n- Projects integrating TenantSaas into non-toy codebases\n- Retention after initial experimentation\n- Frequency of users extending it rather than bypassing it\n- Quality of inbound feedback (long-form issues, design discussions, PRs)\n- References in blog posts, talks, or internal docs\n\n**Adoption & engagement:**\n- Active projects using TenantSaas over time\n- Repeat usage across multiple projects by the same team/org\n- Time from discovery to first meaningful integration\n- Usage in CI or baseline tests\n\n**Ecosystem & pull-through:**\n- Requests for examples/patterns/extensions (not feature breadth)\n- Community contributions that respect the core contract\n- External tools or docs referencing TenantSaas concepts\n- Mentions in discussions about SaaS architecture vs tooling\n\n**Not optimized for:**\n- Raw downloads or stars\n- One-click onboarding metrics\n- Feature requests that dilute the core\n- Broad appeal to all .NET developers\n\n## MVP Scope\n\n### Core Features\n\nThe MVP is the smallest baseline that prevents early architectural regret. It delivers:\n\n- A clear, explicit model for multi-tenant SaaS (tenant, shared infra, scope/context)\n- A small set of enforced invariants (no ambiguous attribution; explicit exceptional behavior)\n- A single unavoidable integration point that anchors the baseline early\n- A proof mechanism (executable tests/assertions/verification hooks)\n\nThe MVP includes a minimal but opinionated core, a precise trust/baseline contract, and documentation that explains the model (not feature breadth).\n\n### Out of Scope for MVP\n\nExplicitly out of scope:\n\n- Billing, subscriptions, pricing, metering\n- Authentication / identity providers\n- Authorization frameworks or RBAC systems\n- UI scaffolding or admin dashboards\n- Feature flags or plan-based behavior\n- Multi-region or data residency support\n- Database sharding or DB-per-tenant orchestration\n- Tenant lifecycle workflows (provisioning/activation)\n- Background job frameworks\n- Observability platforms (metrics, dashboards, tracing)\n- Enterprise compliance tooling (SOC2 automation, GDPR exports)\n- Opinionated frontend stacks\n- Turn-key SaaS templates\n\nAnything that expands surface area, introduces product-specific policy, or can only be validated at scale is deferred.\n\n### MVP Success Criteria\n\n**Adoption & usage:**\n- Integrated into non-toy projects\n- Adopted early in the lifecycle\n- Retained after initial experimentation\n- Core model/API remains stable across projects\n\n**Behavioral signals:**\n- Teams stop inventing bespoke baselines\n- Architectural debates about multi-tenancy shrink or disappear\n- New engineers onboard without long verbal downloads\n- Users extend around the baseline rather than bypass it\n\n**Proof & credibility:**\n- Concrete baseline artifacts exist and are referenced\n- Verification hooks/contract tests are actually run\n- Ambiguous actions are blocked or clarified early\n- External reviewers quickly understand the role\n\n**Negative signals that still indicate success:**\n- Few requests for “everything else”\n- Some users opt out because it’s opinionated\n- Minimal churn due to missing conveniences\n\nIf removing it would feel risky, the MVP succeeded.\n\n### Future Vision\n\nTenantSaas becomes a de facto baseline and trust kernel for serious multi-tenant SaaS systems. The core stays small and conservative while an ecosystem of extensions, examples, integrations, and policy layers grows around it. It becomes the reference point for tenant modeling, scope handling, and shared-system governance-shaping how teams think about SaaS architecture, not just what they scaffold.\n"}}

It targets platform engineers, founders, and security reviewers who need explicit, verifiable guarantees rather than framework-driven scaffolding. Differentiation comes from invariant-first design, explicit refusal behavior, and runnable contract tests that prove guarantees hold across execution paths.\n\n**Problem Statement:** Multi-tenant systems routinely allow actions with ambiguous tenant scope or authority, creating latent cross-tenant risks that are only discovered after incidents.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\nThe primary \"aha\" is a posture shift: teams stop debating multi-tenant assumptions because the baseline makes them obvious.\n\nPrimary signals:\n- New services/features fit cleanly into the baseline without redesign.\n- Developers hit constraints early and think \"good - this would have been messy later.\"\n- The trust contract is treated as the default, not a suggestion.\n\nSecondary signals:\n- Dangerous operations are surfaced explicitly instead of silently allowed.\n- New engineers can learn tenancy from code, not Slack history.\n\n**Metrics (6 months):**\n- >=3 new services integrate TenantSaas within 2 sprints of project start.\n- >=80% of new multi-tenant features ship without baseline redesign.\n- >=90% of services keep the baseline enabled after initial adoption.\n- New engineer onboarding to tenancy concepts takes <=1 day using docs + contract tests.\n\n### Business Success\n\n**~3 months (validation):**\n- Integrated into >=3 real (non-demo) projects.\n- >=50% of integrations happen at project start (greenfield).\n- >=70% of adopters keep it after initial experimentation.\n- >=3 feedback items explicitly reference it as a \"baseline\" or \"foundation.\"\n- >=2 internal docs or architecture notes cite it.\nValidation: the right users take it seriously and keep it.\n\n**~12 months (traction):**\n- Repeat usage by >=2 teams across >=2 projects each.\n- Annual retention >=80% among adopters.\n- >=3 external or internal mentions in blogs, architecture forums, or platform standards.\n- >=5 pull-through requests for examples/extensions/integrations (not core expansion).\n- >=2 teams describe it as infrastructure they would not remove without concern.\nValidation: it is treated as infrastructure, not a trial tool.\n\n### Technical Success\n\n- Core invariants are enforced through unavoidable integration points.\n- Ambiguous or unattributed operations are refused by default.\n- Contract/verification tests exist, are runnable by adopters, and are executed in CI.\n- The core API surface stays small, stable, and resists ad-hoc extension.\n- Behavior is consistent across request paths, background execution, and admin/scripted usage.\nTechnical success = guarantees hold even as usage patterns expand.\n\n**Metrics (technical):**\n- 100% of defined invariants are enforced by contract tests across request, background, and admin paths.\n- Contract test suite runs in CI in <=10 minutes on reference projects.\n- Zero P0/P1 incidents caused by tenant-scope violations in adopter projects during first 6 months.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- Multiple real projects integrate TenantSaas, with at least some greenfield starts.\n- Retention after initial experimentation (kept in place).\n- Documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- Contract tests running in CI across adopters.\n- Repeat adoption across projects by the same teams.\n\n**Metrics (measurable outcomes):**\n- >=3 real integrations, with >=1 greenfield.\n- >=70% retention after initial experimentation.\n- >=2 documented references in internal architecture notes.\n- >=2 adopters running contract tests in CI.\n- >=2 repeat adoptions by the same team/org.\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n- Explicit baseline model for multi-tenant SaaS.\n- One or more enforced invariants that remove ambiguity early.\n- A single unavoidable integration point anchoring the baseline.\n- Verification mechanism (tests/assertions) that proves rules hold.\n- Documentation that explains the model and contract (not features).\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n- Optional extensions/adapters.\n- Reference implementations or example apps.\n- Additional verification/reporting hooks.\n- Integration patterns for common tooling.\n- Better ergonomics around configuration and visibility.\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n- Recognized baseline for serious multi-tenant systems.\n- Core remains small and conservative.\n- Innovation primarily in extensions/examples/ecosystem contributions.\n- Shapes how teams think about SaaS foundations, not just scaffolding.\n- Referenced as a trust kernel, not marketed as a framework.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### 1) Platform engineer integrating TenantSaas into a new service\n\n**Opening scene:** Maya owns platform standards and is starting a new service in a growing SaaS stack. She is wary of tenant ambiguity because prior teams had to retrofit rules later.\n**Rising action:** She evaluates TenantSaas as a baseline, finds a small core package plus contract tests, and identifies the single integration point that every request path must pass through.\n**Climax:** When wiring the first endpoint, the baseline refuses an operation without explicit tenant attribution. It forces a decision at design time, not after launch.\n**Resolution:** Maya adopts the trust contract as a shared team standard. The new service fits into existing architecture without special cases, and future services reuse the same baseline without re-debate.\n\n### 2) On-call responder using elevated scope during an incident (edge case)\n\n**Opening scene:** Jordan is on call when a cross-tenant data correction is required under time pressure.\n**Rising action:** Jordan attempts a privileged operation; the system requires explicit scope elevation with clear intent, not silent admin access.\n**Climax:** The system allows the operation only through a constrained path that is visible and auditable, avoiding accidental overreach.\n**Resolution:** The fix is applied quickly without bypassing the baseline. The incident is resolved and the audit trail is clean, with no special exceptions introduced.\n\n### 3) Founder / early builder adopting at project start\n\n**Opening scene:** Priya is starting a new SaaS product and wants to avoid fixing multi-tenancy later.\n**Rising action:** She adds TenantSaas early because it is small, explicit, and does not prescribe a full framework.\n**Climax:** The baseline forces clarity around tenant context at the first integration point, and Priya realizes she does not need to invent her own conventions.\n**Resolution:** The team moves fast with confidence, knowing the core assumptions are locked in without slowing momentum.\n\n### 4) Security/compliance stakeholder reviewing guarantees\n\n**Opening scene:** Alex is asked to assess tenant isolation guarantees before an external review.\n**Rising action:** Alex inspects the trust contract and verification artifacts rather than chasing tribal knowledge.\n**Climax:** The evidence shows invariants enforced at unavoidable choke points, with contract tests that can be executed in CI.\n**Resolution:** Alex can approve the baseline as a credible control, because the guarantees are explicit and verifiable, not implied.\n\n### 5) API/integration contributor extending or adapting the core\n\n**Opening scene:** Sam wants to create an adapter for a different stack while keeping the core intact.\n**Rising action:** Sam reviews the constraints and sees where extensions are allowed versus where invariants are non-negotiable.\n**Climax:** The adapter integrates through the sanctioned boundary and inherits the same guarantees without widening the core API.\n**Resolution:** The extension adds reach without fragmenting the baseline, and the core remains intentionally small.\n\n### 6) New engineer onboarding into an existing system (acceptance signal)\n\n**Opening scene:** Riley joins an existing team mid-project.\n**Rising action:** Riley reads the baseline code and its contract tests rather than relying on oral history.\n**Climax:** A constrained operation makes the rules explicit, and the correct pattern is discoverable in code.\n**Resolution:** Onboarding requires fewer explanations, which acts as an acceptance signal that the baseline is doing its job.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- A single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context.\n- Explicit tenant attribution required before operations proceed.\n- Controlled, auditable elevation paths for privileged actions.\n- A clear, inspectable trust contract with runnable verification tests.\n- An extension model that preserves invariants and keeps the core small.\n- Baseline conventions are discoverable in code, not tribal knowledge.\n\n## Developer Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nTenantSaas is a developer-facing foundation package for .NET-first multi-tenant systems, with a secondary npm distribution. It is embedded into existing systems as a baseline, not a standalone product.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n- The core package must be minimal, invariant-driven, and safe by default.\n- A single, unavoidable integration point anchors tenant context for request paths and background execution.\n- Verification artifacts (contract tests) are part of the core deliverable and runnable by adopters.\n\n### Language Support (Language Matrix)\n\n- **MVP support:** .NET\n- **Secondary distribution:** npm package (for complementary tooling or examples)\n- **Out of scope for MVP:** other runtimes/languages\n\n### Installation Methods\n\n- **NuGet** as the primary installation path.\n- **npm** for any supporting tooling or integration snippets.\n- No IDE/editor extensions in scope for MVP.\n\n### API Surface\n\n- Small, stable API surface focused on tenant context, invariants, and verification hooks.\n- Avoid extension points that bypass invariants or widen core behavior.\n- Explicit refusal paths for ambiguous attribution or privileged actions.\n\n### Documentation & Guides (Required for MVP)\n\n- Concise conceptual model.\n- Explicit trust contract.\n- Minimal integration guide.\n- Runnable verification/contract tests guide.\n- Small API reference (focused on the core surface only).\n\n### Code Examples\n\n- One minimal sample project.\n- Copy-paste integration snippets.\n- No full reference application for MVP.\n\n### Migration Guide\n\n- MVP: no migration guide required (greenfield-first baseline).\n- Future: add a migration guide if adopting into existing systems becomes a primary use case.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- Baseline must be hard to remove once integrated, without adding operational friction.\n- Contract tests should be easily wired into CI with minimal configuration.\n- Keep documentation crisp and enforce the mental model over feature descriptions.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Problem-solving MVP (prove guarantees are real and usable), with platform discipline for extensibility.\n**Resource Requirements:** 1 person with strong backend/systems thinking, multi-tenant architecture expertise, API/contract design, test rigor, and clear technical writing.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Platform engineer integrating into a new service\n- Founder/early builder starting a project\n- Security/compliance reviewer inspecting guarantees\n- Contributor reading/extending the core (design-level)\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Explicit baseline model (tenancy, shared system, scope)\n- One unavoidable integration point\n- Enforced invariants (small, non-negotiable)\n- Verification mechanism (contract tests or equivalent)\n- Clear non-goals and refusal behavior\n- Minimal sample + integration snippets\n- Conceptual + contract documentation\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- On-call incident workflows (documented, not deeply supported)\n- New-hire onboarding narratives\n- Advanced ops/support tooling\n- Additional adapters or helpers\n- Observability hooks\n- More ergonomic APIs\n- Extended examples (jobs, reporting, admin)\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- Reference app\n- Ecosystem packages and optional extensions\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Guarantees too weak to matter or too rigid to use. Mitigate by keeping invariants minimal, validating in at least one real integration, and treating escape hatches as design failures unless explicitly justified.\n**Market Risks:** Misinterpreted as just another library or too abstract. Mitigate by leading with problem framing, stating non-goals clearly, and anchoring messaging on baseline/foundation rather than productivity.\n**Resource Risks:** Over-engineering and drifting into framework territory. Mitigate by freezing scope, requiring a new invariant for any new capability, and deleting ideas rather than deferring them.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Tenant Context & Baseline Model\n\n- FR1: Platform engineers can define the canonical tenant identity model used across the system.\n- FR2: The system can represent tenant scope and shared-system scope as explicit, distinct contexts.\n- FR3: The system can represent a no tenant state only when explicitly justified by the trust contract.\n- FR4: Developers can attach tenant context explicitly to operations before execution.\n- FR5: The baseline model can be referenced as a single source of truth by services integrating it.\n\n### Invariant Enforcement & Refusal Behavior\n\n- FR6: The system can refuse operations with ambiguous or missing tenant attribution.\n- FR7: The system can enforce an explicit invariant set of <=7 invariants defined and enumerated in the trust contract.\n- FR8: Invariant enforcement applies uniformly across request, background, administrative, and scripted execution paths.\n- FR9: The system can surface refusal reasons explicitly to developers when invariants are violated.\n- FR10: Privileged or cross-tenant operations require explicit intent and cannot proceed silently.\n\n### Integration Point & Context Propagation\n\n- FR11: The system provides a single, unavoidable integration point for tenant context initialization.\n- FR12: The integration point can propagate tenant context to downstream operations consistently.\n- FR13: The integration point can reject execution when required context is absent or inconsistent.\n- FR14: Services can integrate the baseline without adopting a full framework or templated scaffold.\n\n### Verification & Contract Tests\n\n- FR15: The system provides runnable verification artifacts that test invariant enforcement.\n- FR16: Teams can execute contract tests as part of CI to prove baseline adherence.\n- FR17: Contract tests can be run by adopters without specialized tooling beyond the package.\n- FR18: Verification artifacts can demonstrate behavior across multiple execution contexts.\n\n### Documentation & Trust Contract\n\n- FR19: The system provides a conceptual model describing tenancy, scope, and shared-system context in <=800 words or <=2 pages.\n- FR20: The system provides an explicit trust contract that defines invariants and refusal behavior.\n- FR21: The system provides an integration guide with <=6 required steps and a reference setup time <=30 minutes.\n- FR22: The system provides a verification guide that explains how to run and interpret contract tests.\n- FR23: The system provides an API reference that covers 100% of public surface area and lists all public types/entry points.\n\n### Extensibility & Adapter Boundaries\n\n- FR24: The system defines explicit boundaries where extensions may be built without weakening invariants.\n- FR25: Adapters can integrate through sanctioned boundaries while preserving the trust contract.\n- FR26: The core surface blocks bypass paths by restricting entry points to sanctioned boundaries, verified by contract tests covering 100% of public entry points.\n\n### Developer Onboarding & Discoverability (Acceptance Signals Only)\n\n- FR27: New engineers can locate the trust contract and run contract tests within 60 minutes using the docs alone.\n- FR28: 100% of refusal errors include actionable guidance and a link to the relevant contract rule, verified by contract tests.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Security\n\n- The system shall reject 100% of operations with missing or ambiguous tenant attribution as measured by contract tests covering request, background, and admin paths.\n- Privileged or cross-scope actions shall require explicit scope declaration and justification fields, verified by contract tests for all privileged operations.\n- The system shall produce zero silent fallbacks when required context is missing, verified by negative tests in CI.\n- Security-relevant behavior shall be covered by contract tests with >=90% branch coverage in the enforcement module, measured in CI.\n\n### Reliability\n\n- Invariant enforcement shall be deterministic across 10 repeated CI runs with identical inputs yielding identical outcomes (0 variance).\n- Failure modes shall return explicit error codes/messages for 100% of invariant violations, verified by contract tests.\n- Invariant check failures shall return within <=100ms at p95 in reference benchmarks.\n- Core guarantees shall pass the same contract tests across local and CI environments with 0 environment-specific skips.\n\n### Integration\n\n- All request paths shall pass through the single integration point in the reference project, verified by tracing tests with 100% coverage.\n- Integration shall require no changes to domain/business logic in the reference project (0 files under domain namespaces modified), verified by sample diff.\n- The integration guide shall include a full wiring example and complete successfully in <=30 minutes for a new service, measured in onboarding trials.\n- If the integration point is removed or bypassed, contract tests shall fail in CI with a specific error within a single test run.\n\n### Performance\n\n- Baseline overhead shall add <=1ms at p95 per request in a reference benchmark of 10,000 requests.\n- Enforcement checks shall add <=5% latency when tenant count scales from 1 to 10,000, measured by benchmark.\n- The baseline shall start zero background polling loops or timers by default, verified by runtime inspection tests.\n\n### Scalability\n\n- Contract tests shall pass with tenant counts of 1, 100, and 10,000 in load simulations.\n- Reference architecture shall demonstrate multi-service and multi-database topology without special casing, verified by documented example and integration test.\n- All invariants shall remain enforced under 10x load compared to baseline, verified by load tests.\n\n### Accessibility\n\n- Not applicable. TenantSaas has no end-user UI surface.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Review Project Requirements\n\n**From PRD Analysis:**\n\n- Extract and analyze Functional Requirements (FRs)\n- Identify Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) like performance, security, compliance\n- Note any technical constraints or dependencies mentioned\n- Count and categorize requirements to understand project scale\n\n**From Epics/Stories (if available):**\n\n- Map epic structure and user stories to architectural components\n- Extract acceptance criteria for technical implications\n- Identify cross-cutting concerns that span multiple epics\n- Estimate story complexity for architectural planning\n\n**From UX Design (if available):**\n\n- Extract architectural implications from UX requirements:\n  - Component complexity (simple forms vs rich interactions)\n  - Animation/transition requirements\n  - Real-time update needs (live data, collaborative features)\n  - Platform-specific UI requirements\n  - Accessibility standards (WCAG compliance level)\n  - Responsive design breakpoints\n  - Offline capability requirements\n  - Performance expectations (load times, interaction responsiveness)\n\n### 2. Project Scale Assessment\n\nCalculate and present project complexity:\n\n**Complexity Indicators:**\n\n- Real-time features requirements\n- Multi-tenancy needs\n- Regulatory compliance requirements\n- Integration complexity\n- User interaction complexity\n- Data complexity and volume\n\n### 3. Reflect Understanding\n\nPresent your analysis back to user for validation:\n\n\"I'm reviewing your project documentation for {{project_name}}.\n\n{if_epics_loaded}I see {{epic_count}} epics with {{story_count}} total stories.{/if_epics_loaded}\n{if_no_epics}I found {{fr_count}} functional requirements organized into {{fr_category_list}}.{/if_no_epics}\n{if_ux_loaded}I also found your UX specification which defines the user experience requirements.{/if_ux_loaded}\n\n**Key architectural aspects I notice:**\n\n- [Summarize core functionality from FRs]\n- [Note critical NFRs that will shape architecture]\n- {if_ux_loaded}[Note UX complexity and technical requirements]{/if_ux_loaded}\n- [Identify unique technical challenges or constraints]\n- [Highlight any regulatory or compliance requirements]\n\n**Scale indicators:**\n\n- Project complexity appears to be: [low/medium/high/enterprise]\n- Primary technical domain: [web/mobile/api/backend/full-stack/etc]\n- Cross-cutting concerns identified: [list major ones]\n\nThis analysis will help me guide you through the architectural decisions needed to ensure AI agents implement this consistently.\n\nDoes this match your understanding of the project scope and requirements?\"\n\n### 4. Generate Project Context Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\n{{analysis of FRs and what they mean architecturally}}\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n{{NFRs that will drive architectural decisions}}\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\n{{project_scale_assessment}}\n\n- Primary domain: {{technical_domain}}\n- Complexity level: {{complexity_level}}\n- Estimated architectural components: {{component_count}}\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n{{known_constraints_dependencies}}\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n{{concerns_that_will_affect_multiple_components}}\n```\n\n### 5.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Check Technical Preferences & Context\n\n**Check Project Context for Existing Technical Preferences:**\n\"Before we dive into starter templates, let me check if you have any technical preferences already documented.\n\n{{if_project_context_exists}}\nI found some technical rules in your project context file:\n{{extracted_technical_preferences_from_project_context}}\n\n**Project Context Technical Rules Found:**\n\n- Languages/Frameworks: {{languages_frameworks_from_context}}\n- Tools & Libraries: {{tools_from_context}}\n- Development Patterns: {{patterns_from_context}}\n- Platform Preferences: {{platforms_from_context}}\n\n{{else}}\nNo existing technical preferences found in project context file. We'll establish your technical preferences now.\n{{/if_project_context}}\"\n\n**Discover User Technical Preferences:**\n\"Based on your project context, let's discuss your technical preferences:\n\n{{primary_technology_category}} Preferences:\n\n- **Languages**: Do you have preferences between TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.?\n- **Frameworks**: Any existing familiarity or preferences (React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, etc.)?\n- **Databases**: Any preferences or existing infrastructure (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)?\n\n**Development Experience:**\n\n- What's your team's experience level with different technologies?\n- Are there any technologies you want to learn vs. what you're comfortable with?\n\n**Platform/Deployment Preferences:**\n\n- Cloud provider preferences (AWS, Vercel, Railway, etc.)?\n- Container preferences (Docker, Serverless, Traditional)?\n\n**Integrations:**\n\n- Any existing systems or APIs you need to integrate with?\n- Third-party services you plan to use (payment, authentication, analytics, etc.)?\n\nThese preferences will help me recommend the most suitable starter templates and guide our architectural decisions.\"\n\n### 1. Identify Primary Technology Domain\n\nBased on project context analysis and technical preferences, identify the primary technology stack:\n\n- **Web application** → Look for Next.js, Vite, Remix, SvelteKit starters\n- **Mobile app** → Look for React Native, Expo, Flutter starters\n- **API/Backend** → Look for NestJS, Express, Fastify, Supabase starters\n- **CLI tool** → Look for CLI framework starters (oclif, commander, etc.)\n- **Full-stack** → Look for T3, RedwoodJS, Blitz, Next.js starters\n- **Desktop** → Look for Electron, Tauri starters\n\n### 2. UX Requirements Consideration\n\nIf UX specification was loaded, consider UX requirements when selecting starter:\n\n- **Rich animations** → Framer Motion compatible starter\n- **Complex forms** → React Hook Form included starter\n- **Real-time features** → Socket.io or WebSocket ready starter\n- **Design system** → Storybook-enabled starter\n- **Offline capability** → Service worker or PWA configured starter\n\n### 3. Research Current Starter Options\n\nSearch the web to find current, maintained starter templates:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} starter template CLI create command latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} boilerplate generator latest options\"\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} production-ready starter best practices\"\n```\n\n### 4. Investigate Top Starter Options\n\nFor each promising starter found, investigate details:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} default setup technologies included latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} project structure file organization\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} production deployment capabilities\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} recent updates maintenance status\"\n```\n\n### 5. Analyze What Each Starter Provides\n\nFor each viable starter option, document:\n\n**Technology Decisions Made:**\n\n- Language/TypeScript configuration\n- Styling solution (CSS, Tailwind, Styled Components, etc.)\n- Testing framework setup\n- Linting/Formatting configuration\n- Build tooling and optimization\n- Project structure and organization\n\n**Architectural Patterns Established:**\n\n- Code organization patterns\n- Component structure conventions\n- API layering approach\n- State management setup\n- Routing patterns\n- Environment configuration\n\n**Development Experience Features:**\n\n- Hot reloading and development server\n- TypeScript configuration\n- Debugging setup\n- Testing infrastructure\n- Documentation generation\n\n### 6. Present Starter Options\n\nBased on user skill level and project needs:\n\n**For Expert Users:**\n\"Found {{starter_name}} which provides:\n{{quick_decision_list_of_key_decisions}}\n\nThis would establish our base architecture with these technical decisions already made. Use it?\"\n\n**For Intermediate Users:**\n\"I found {{starter_name}}, which is a well-maintained starter for {{project_type}} projects.\n\nIt makes these architectural decisions for us:\n{{decision_list_with_explanations}}\n\nThis gives us a solid foundation following current best practices. Should we use it?\"\n\n**For Beginner Users:**\n\"I found {{starter_name}}, which is like a pre-built foundation for your project.\n\nThink of it like buying a prefab house frame instead of cutting each board yourself.\n\nIt makes these decisions for us:\n{{friendly_explanation_of_decisions}}\n\nThis is a great starting point that follows best practices and saves us from making dozens of small technical choices. Should we use it?\"\n\n### 7. Get Current CLI Commands\n\nIf user shows interest in a starter, get the exact current commands:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} CLI command options flags latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} create new project command examples\"\n```\n\n### 8. Generate Starter Template Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n````markdown\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\n{{identified_domain}} based on project requirements analysis\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n{{analysis_of_evaluated_starters}}\n\n### Selected Starter: {{starter_name}}\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\n{{why_this_starter_was_chosen}}\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\n{{full_starter_command_with_options}}\n```\n````\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\n{{language_typescript_setup}}\n\n**Styling Solution:**\n{{styling_solution_configuration}}\n\n**Build Tooling:**\n{{build_tools_and_optimization}}\n\n**Testing Framework:**\n{{testing_setup_and_configuration}}\n\n**Code Organization:**\n{{project_structure_and_patterns}}\n\n**Development Experience:**\n{{development_tools_and_workflow}}\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n```\n\n### 9. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated content and present choices:\n\n\"I've analyzed starter template options for {{project_type}} projects.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 8]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore custom approaches or unconventional starters\n[P] Party Mode - Evaluate trade-offs from different perspectives\n[C] Continue - Save this decision and move to architectural decisions\"\n\n### 10. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with current starter analysis\n- Process enhanced insights about starter options or custom approaches\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the starter template evaluation? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with starter evaluation context\n- Process collaborative insights about starter trade-offs\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the starter template evaluation? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`\n- Load `./step-04-decisions.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 8.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Primary technology domain correctly identified from project context\n✅ Current, maintained starter templates researched and evaluated\n✅ All versions verified using web search, not hardcoded\n✅ Architectural implications of starter choice clearly documented\n✅ User provided with clear rationale for starter selection\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not verifying current versions with web search\n❌ Ignoring UX requirements when evaluating starters\n❌ Not documenting what architectural decisions the starter makes\n❌ Failing to consider maintenance status of starter templates\n❌ Not providing clear rationale for starter selection\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-04-decisions.md` to begin making specific architectural decisions.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-04 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n```\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Facilitate Each Decision Category\n\nFor each category, facilitate collaborative decision making:\n\n**Present the Decision:**\nBased on user skill level and project context:\n\n**Expert Mode:**\n\"{{Decision_Category}}: {{Specific_Decision}}\n\nOptions: {{concise_option_list_with_tradeoffs}}\n\nWhat's your preference for this decision?\"\n\n**Intermediate Mode:**\n\"Next decision: {{Human_Friendly_Category}}\n\nWe need to choose {{Specific_Decision}}.\n\nCommon options:\n{{option_list_with_brief_explanations}}\n\nFor your project, I'd lean toward {{recommendation}} because {{reason}}. What are your thoughts?\"\n\n**Beginner Mode:**\n\"Let's talk about {{Human_Friendly_Category}}.\n\n{{Educational_Context_About_Why_This_Matters}}\n\nThink of it like {{real_world_analogy}}.\n\nYour main options:\n{{friendly_options_with_pros_cons}}\n\nMy suggestion: {{recommendation}}\nThis is good for you because {{beginner_friendly_reason}}.\n\nWhat feels right to you?\"\n\n**Verify Technology Versions:**\nIf decision involves specific technology:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{technology}} latest stable version\"\nSearch the web: \"{{technology}} current LTS version\"\nSearch the web: \"{{technology}} production readiness\"\n```\n\n**Get User Input:**\n\"What's your preference? (or 'explain more' for details)\"\n\n**Handle User Response:**\n\n- If user wants more info: Provide deeper explanation\n- If user has preference: Discuss implications and record decision\n- If user wants alternatives: Explore other options\n\n**Record the Decision:**\n\n- Category: {{category}}\n- Decision: {{user_choice}}\n- Version: {{verified_version_if_applicable}}\n- Rationale: {{user_reasoning_or_default}}\n- Affects: {{components_or_epics}}\n- Provided by Starter: {{yes_if_from_starter}}\n\n### 4. Check for Cascading Implications\n\nAfter each major decision, identify related decisions:\n\n\"This choice means we'll also need to decide:\n\n- {{related_decision_1}}\n- {{related_decision_2}}\"\n\n### 5. Generate Decisions Content\n\nAfter facilitating all decision categories, prepare the content to append:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n{{critical_decisions_made}}\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n{{important_decisions_made}}\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n{{decisions_deferred_with_rationale}}\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n{{data_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n{{security_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n{{api_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n{{frontend_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n{{infrastructure_related_decisions_with_versions_and_rationale}}\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n{{ordered_list_of_decisions_for_implementation}}\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n{{how_decisions_affect_each_other}}\n```\n\n### 6. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated decisions content and present choices:\n\n\"I've documented all the core architectural decisions we've made together.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 5]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore innovative approaches to any specific decisions\n[P] Party Mode - Review decisions from multiple perspectives\n[C] Continue - Save these decisions and move to implementation patterns\"\n\n### 7. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with specific decision categories\n- Process enhanced insights about particular decisions\n- Ask user: \"Accept these enhancements to the architectural decisions? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with architectural decisions context\n- Process collaborative insights about decision trade-offs\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the architectural decisions? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n- Load `./step-05-patterns.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 5.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ All critical architectural decisions made collaboratively\n✅ Technology versions verified using web search\n✅ Decision rationale clearly documented\n✅ Cascading implications identified and addressed\n✅ User provided appropriate level of explanation for skill level\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly for each category\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Making recommendations instead of facilitating decisions\n❌ Not verifying technology versions with web search\n❌ Missing cascading implications between decisions\n❌ Not adapting explanations to user skill level\n❌ Forgetting to document decisions made by starter template\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-05-patterns.md` to define implementation patterns that ensure consistency across AI agents.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-05 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The goal is to prove one invariant: multi-tenant entities cannot be saved without an active tenant context, and cross-tenant modifications are blocked.\n\n## Invariant Being Enforced\n\n- A tenant context is required for any `IMultiTenant` change.\n- Added entities inherit the active tenant if `TenantId` is empty.\n- Modified and deleted entities must match the original tenant id.\n\n## Build and Test\n\n- `dotnet build` — builds the solution.\n- `dotnet test` — runs the xUnit tests using SQLite file databases.\n\n## Usage\n\nUse `CurrentTenant.Use` to scope a tenant, then save through a `TenantDbContext`:\n\n```csharp\nvar currentTenant = new CurrentTenant();\nusing (currentTenant.Use(\"tenant-a\"))\n{\n    using var context = TestSqliteDatabase.CreateContext(dbPath, currentTenant);\n    context.Widgets.Add(new Widget { Name = \"Widget\" });\n    await context.SaveChangesAsync();\n}\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n- `ExecuteUpdate` and `ExecuteDelete` bypass `SaveChanges` and are not protected by these invariants; bulk ops don't use change tracking.\n- Detached `IMultiTenant` updates/deletes (e.g., `Attach`/`Update`) are intentionally rejected; load entities in the current `DbContext`.\n\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Analyze Requirements Mapping\n\nMap project requirements to architectural components:\n\n**From Epics (if available):**\n\"Epic: {{epic_name}} → Lives in {{module/directory/service}}\"\n\n- User stories within the epic\n- Cross-epic dependencies\n- Shared components needed\n\n**From FR Categories (if no epics):**\n\"FR Category: {{fr_category_name}} → Lives in {{module/directory/service}}\"\n\n- Related functional requirements\n- Shared functionality across categories\n- Integration points between categories\n\n### 2. Define Project Directory Structure\n\nBased on technology stack and patterns, create the complete project structure:\n\n**Root Configuration Files:**\n\n- Package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)\n- Build and development configuration\n- Environment configuration files\n- CI/CD pipeline files\n- Documentation files\n\n**Source Code Organization:**\n\n- Application entry points\n- Core application structure\n- Feature/module organization\n- Shared utilities and libraries\n- Configuration and environment files\n\n**Test Organization:**\n\n- Unit test locations and structure\n- Integration test organization\n- End-to-end test structure\n- Test utilities and fixtures\n\n**Build and Distribution:**\n\n- Build output directories\n- Distribution files\n- Static assets\n- Documentation build\n\n### 3. Define Integration Boundaries\n\nMap how components communicate and where boundaries exist:\n\n**API Boundaries:**\n\n- External API endpoints\n- Internal service boundaries\n- Authentication and authorization boundaries\n- Data access layer boundaries\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n\n- Frontend component communication patterns\n- State management boundaries\n- Service communication patterns\n- Event-driven integration points\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n\n- Database schema boundaries\n- Data access patterns\n- Caching boundaries\n- External data integration points\n\n### 4. Create Complete Project Tree\n\nGenerate a comprehensive directory structure showing all files and directories:\n\n**Technology-Specific Structure Examples:**\n\n**Next.js Full-Stack:**\n\n```\nproject-name/\n├── README.md\n├── package.json\n├── next.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.js\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── .env.local\n├── .env.example\n├── .gitignore\n├── .github/\n│   └── workflows/\n│       └── ci.yml\n├── src/\n│   ├── app/\n│   │   ├── globals.css\n│   │   ├── layout.tsx\n│   │   └── page.tsx\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   ├── forms/\n│   │   └── features/\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   ├── db.ts\n│   │   ├── auth.ts\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── types/\n│   └── middleware.ts\n├── prisma/\n│   ├── schema.prisma\n│   └── migrations/\n├── tests/\n│   ├── __mocks__/\n│   ├── components/\n│   └── e2e/\n└── public/\n    └── assets/\n```\n\n**API Backend (NestJS):**\n\n```\nproject-name/\n├── package.json\n├── nest-cli.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── .env\n├── .env.example\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.ts\n│   ├── app.module.ts\n│   ├── config/\n│   ├── modules/\n│   │   ├── auth/\n│   │   ├── users/\n│   │   └── common/\n│   ├── services/\n│   ├── repositories/\n│   ├── decorators/\n│   ├── pipes/\n│   ├── guards/\n│   └── interceptors/\n├── test/\n│   ├── unit/\n│   ├── integration/\n│   └── e2e/\n├── prisma/\n│   ├── schema.prisma\n│   └── migrations/\n└── docker-compose.yml\n```\n\n### 5. Map Requirements to Structure\n\nCreate explicit mapping from project requirements to specific files/directories:\n\n**Epic/Feature Mapping:**\n\"Epic: User Management\n\n- Components: src/components/features/users/\n- Services: src/services/users/\n- API Routes: src/app/api/users/\n- Database: prisma/migrations/_*users*_\n- Tests: tests/features/users/\"\n\n**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**\n\"Authentication System\n\n- Components: src/components/auth/\n- Services: src/services/auth/\n- Middleware: src/middleware/auth.ts\n- Guards: src/guards/auth.guard.ts\n- Tests: tests/auth/\"\n\n### 6. Generate Structure Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\n\n{{complete_project_tree_with_all_files_and_directories}}\n\n```\n\n### Architectural Boundaries\n\n**API Boundaries:**\n{{api_boundary_definitions_and_endpoints}}\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n{{component_communication_patterns_and_boundaries}}\n\n**Service Boundaries:**\n{{service_integration_patterns_and_boundaries}}\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n{{data_access_patterns_and_boundaries}}\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**Feature/Epic Mapping:**\n{{mapping_of_epics_or_features_to_specific_directories}}\n\n**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**\n{{mapping_of_shared_functionality_to_locations}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal Communication:**\n{{how_components_within_the_project_communicate}}\n\n**External Integrations:**\n{{third_party_service_integration_points}}\n\n**Data Flow:**\n{{how_data_flows_through_the_architecture}}\n\n### File Organization Patterns\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n{{where_and_how_config_files_are_organized}}\n\n**Source Organization:**\n{{how_source_code_is_structured_and_organized}}\n\n**Test Organization:**\n{{how_tests_are_structured_and_organized}}\n\n**Asset Organization:**\n{{how_static_and_dynamic_assets_are_organized}}\n\n### Development Workflow Integration\n\n**Development Server Structure:**\n{{how_the_project_is organized_for_development}}\n\n**Build Process Structure:**\n{{how_the_build_process_uses_the_project_structure}}\n\n**Deployment Structure:**\n{{how_the_project_structure_supports_deployment}}\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated project structure content and present choices:\n\n\"I've created a complete project structure based on all our architectural decisions.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore innovative project organization approaches\n[P] Party Mode - Review structure from different development perspectives\n[C] Continue - Save this structure and move to architecture validation\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with current project structure\n- Process enhanced organizational insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the project structure? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with project structure context\n- Process collaborative insights about organization trade-offs\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the project structure? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n- Load `./step-07-validation.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Complete project tree defined with all files and directories\n✅ All architectural boundaries clearly documented\n✅ Requirements/epics mapped to specific locations\n✅ Integration points and communication patterns defined\n✅ Project structure aligned with chosen technology stack\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Creating generic placeholder structure instead of specific, complete tree\n❌ Not mapping requirements to specific files and directories\n❌ Missing important integration boundaries\n❌ Not considering the chosen technology stack in structure design\n❌ Not defining how components communicate across boundaries\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-07-validation.md` to validate architectural coherence and completeness.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-07 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Check for Existing Project Context\n\nFirst, check if project context already exists:\n\n- Look for file at `{project_knowledge}/project-context.md or {project-root}/**/project-context.md`\n- If exists: Read complete file to understand existing rules\n- Present to user: \"Found existing project context with {number_of_sections} sections. Would you like to update this or create a new one?\"\n\n### 2. Discover Project Technology Stack\n\nLoad and analyze project files to identify technologies:\n\n**Architecture Document:**\n\n- Look for `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`\n- Extract technology choices with specific versions\n- Note architectural decisions that affect implementation\n\n**Package Files:**\n\n- Check for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.\n- Extract exact versions of all dependencies\n- Note development vs production dependencies\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n\n- Look for project language specific configs ( example: `tsconfig.json`)\n- Build tool configs (webpack, vite, next.config.js, etc.)\n- Linting and formatting configs (.eslintrc, .prettierrc, etc.)\n- Testing configurations (jest.config.js, vitest.config.ts, etc.)\n\n### 3. Identify Existing Code Patterns\n\nSearch through existing codebase for patterns:\n\n**Naming Conventions:**\n\n- File naming patterns (PascalCase, kebab-case, etc.)\n- Component/function naming conventions\n- Variable naming patterns\n- Test file naming patterns\n\n**Code Organization:**\n\n- How components are structured\n- Where utilities and helpers are placed\n- How services are organized\n- Test organization patterns\n\n**Documentation Patterns:**\n\n- Comment styles and conventions\n- Documentation requirements\n- README and API doc patterns\n\n### 4. Extract Critical Implementation Rules\n\nLook for rules that AI agents might miss:\n\n**Language-Specific Rules:**\n\n- TypeScript strict mode requirements\n- Import/export conventions\n- Async/await vs Promise usage patterns\n- Error handling patterns specific to the language\n\n**Framework-Specific Rules:**\n\n- React hooks usage patterns\n- API route conventions\n- Middleware usage patterns\n- State management patterns\n\n**Testing Rules:**\n\n- Test structure requirements\n- Mock usage conventions\n- Integration vs unit test boundaries\n- Coverage requirements\n\n**Development Workflow Rules:**\n\n- Branch naming conventions\n- Commit message patterns\n- PR review requirements\n- Deployment procedures\n\n### 5. Initialize Project Context Document\n\nBased on discovery, create or update the context document:\n\n#### A. Fresh Document Setup (if no existing context)\n\nCopy template from `{installed_path}/project-context-template.md` to `{output_folder}/project-context.md`\nInitialize frontmatter fields.\n\n#### B. Existing Document Update\n\nLoad existing context and prepare for updates\nSet frontmatter `sections_completed` to track what will be updated\n\n### 6. Present Discovery Summary\n\nReport findings to user:\n\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've analyzed your project for {{project_name}} to discover the context that AI agents need.\n\n**Technology Stack Discovered:**\n{{list_of_technologies_with_versions}}\n\n**Existing Patterns Found:**\n\n- {{number_of_patterns}} implementation patterns\n- {{number_of_conventions}} coding conventions\n- {{number_of_rules}} critical rules\n\n**Key Areas for Context Rules:**\n\n- {{area_1}} (e.g., TypeScript configuration)\n- {{area_2}} (e.g., Testing patterns)\n- {{area_3}} (e.g., Code organization)\n\n{if_existing_context}\n**Existing Context:** Found {{sections}} sections already defined.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe FRs define a strict tenant-context model with explicit attribution, a small invariant set (<=7), and uniform enforcement across request, background, admin, and scripted paths. A single unavoidable integration point must initialize and propagate context. The baseline must refuse ambiguous actions and surface explicit refusal reasons. Verification artifacts (contract tests) are first-class deliverables and must be runnable by adopters in CI. Documentation is part of the core contract: a concise conceptual model, explicit trust contract, integration guide, and full API reference. Extension points are allowed only through sanctioned boundaries that preserve invariants; bypass paths are explicitly blocked and tested. Onboarding requirements emphasize discoverability and actionable errors.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nSecurity and correctness dominate: 100% rejection of ambiguous attribution, explicit privileged action gating, deterministic enforcement, and zero silent fallbacks. Reliability requires consistent behavior across execution contexts and repeated runs. Integration must be unavoidable and non-invasive to domain logic, with contract tests catching bypasses. Performance and scalability targets are tight (low latency overhead, no default background loops, invariants hold under scale).\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nComplexity is medium-to-high due to safety guarantees, cross-context enforcement, and proof requirements.\n\n- Primary domain: backend/platform developer tool (multi-tenant SaaS baseline)\n- Complexity level: medium-to-high\n- Estimated architectural components: 6-8 (core context model, enforcement engine, integration boundary, context propagation, contract tests, docs/contract, sample integration, packaging/distribution)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- MVP language: .NET; secondary npm distribution for tooling/examples.\n- No end-user UI; UX work limited to developer ergonomics, docs flow, and error messaging.\n- Small, stable API surface; invariants must be non-bypassable.\n- Single unavoidable integration point for all execution paths.\n- Contract tests are mandatory and must be CI-ready.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Tenant attribution as a hard requirement across all paths.\n- Explicit refusal behavior and error guidance.\n- Privilege elevation with explicit intent and auditability.\n- Deterministic enforcement and proof via contract tests.\n- Performance overhead limits and predictable behavior under scale.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nBackend/platform developer tool (multi-tenant SaaS baseline) based on the project requirements.\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n**.NET SDK default templates (`dotnet new`)**  \nVerified on Microsoft Learn as the current, maintained templates that ship with the .NET SDK (solution, class library, xUnit, web API).\n\nRationale: Minimal, unopinionated scaffolding that fits a trust-kernel library and avoids unnecessary framework assumptions.\n\n### Selected Starter: .NET SDK default templates (monorepo baseline)\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\n- Aligns with .NET-first MVP and a minimal, invariant-focused core.\n- Keeps surface area small and avoids architectural bias.\n- Provides contract-test scaffolding (xUnit) and a reference host (web API) without dictating runtime architecture.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\ndotnet new sln -n TenantSaas\n\ndotnet new classlib -n TenantSaas.Core -f net10.0\ndotnet new xunit -n TenantSaas.ContractTests -f net10.0\ndotnet new webapi -n TenantSaas.Sample -f net10.0\n\ndotnet sln TenantSaas.sln add \\\n  TenantSaas.Core/TenantSaas.Core.csproj \\\n  TenantSaas.ContractTests/TenantSaas.ContractTests.csproj \\\n  TenantSaas.Sample/TenantSaas.Sample.csproj\n```\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\n- .NET 10 target framework for all projects.\n\n**Build Tooling:**\n- Standard .NET SDK build pipeline and solution structure.\n\n**Testing Framework:**\n- xUnit scaffold for contract tests.\n\n**Code Organization:**\n- Monorepo with separate projects for core, contract tests, and sample host.\n\n**Development Experience:**\n- Standard SDK CLI workflows; no added tooling assumptions.\n\n**Note:** Project initialization using this command should be the first implementation story.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- .NET 10 monorepo baseline with EF Core reference adapter.\n- TenantFence-style tenant context + SaveChanges guard invariants.\n- Refuse-by-default enforcement with strictly constrained break-glass path.\n- Contract tests as first-class verification artifacts.\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- REST Minimal APIs for sample host.\n- Swagger endpoint docs + minimal handwritten guidance.\n- Problem Details (RFC 7807) as the sole error format.\n- BYO-auth stance with runnable API key sample.\n- Structured logging with optional OpenTelemetry hooks.\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Packaging strategy (NuGet layout, multi-package split).\n- Distributed caching (Redis, etc.).\n- Auth provider integrations (OIDC/other).\n- Rate limiting implementation.\n- Production infrastructure templates.\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Datastore (reference/sample):** SQLite (abstracted).\n- **Reference persistence adapter:** EF Core (current 10.0).\n- **Modeling approach:** `CurrentTenant` scope + `TenantDbContext` SaveChanges guard (TenantFence-style).\n- **Caching:** In-memory only, abstracted behind interface.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Auth in sample:** Simple API key (runnable) + official BYO-auth stance.\n- **Authorization pattern:** Thin, tenant-scoped guard/policy module portable across HTTP/jobs/scripts.\n- **Middleware posture:** Refuse-by-default with optional, strictly constrained break-glass path.\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **API style:** REST Minimal APIs.\n- **API docs:** Swagger (Swashbuckle.AspNetCore 10.1.0) + minimal handwritten guidance (non-duplicative).\n- **Errors:** Problem Details (RFC 7807) only.\n- **Rate limiting:** Documented recommendation only (no implementation).\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- Not applicable (no UI).\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Sample hosting:** `dotnet run` + Dockerfile (optional docker-compose).\n- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions build/test/pack; release on tags.\n- **Observability:** Library emits structured logs; optional OpenTelemetry hooks (OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting 1.15.0, OTLP exporter 1.15.0) demonstrated in sample.\n- **Scaling:** Docs-first with “known failure modes” and recommended patterns; no infra implementation.\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1) Define tenant context + policy guard contract (core).\n2) Implement EF Core `TenantDbContext` SaveChanges guard.\n3) Add contract tests (xUnit) for invariants and refusal behavior.\n4) Add sample host (Minimal API) with API key auth and Problem Details.\n5) Add Swagger docs + minimal guidance.\n6) Add logging hooks; optional OTel example.\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Contract tests depend on core invariants and EF Core adapter.\n- Sample host depends on policy guard and error handling standard.\n- Logging/observability hooks must wrap guard/tenant context to preserve traceability.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\nNaming, structure, API formats, error handling, logging fields, and date/time formatting.\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n- Tables and columns use `camelCase` (e.g., `tenantId`, `createdAt`).\n- No underscore prefixes anywhere.\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n- REST endpoints are plural nouns: `/tenants`, `/invariants`, `/contexts`.\n- Route parameters are explicit: `/tenants/{tenantId}` (never `{id}`).\n- Query parameters are `camelCase` (e.g., `includeDeleted`).\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Standard .NET naming: PascalCase types/methods, camelCase locals/fields.\n- No underscore prefixes anywhere.\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- Flat root structure (no `src/` or `tests/` folders).\n- Per-project `*.Tests` projects only (no tests subfolder).\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n- Shared utilities live in `TenantSaas.Core/Common`.\n- Samples live under dedicated `TenantSaas.Sample` project.\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n- Success responses return direct resource payloads (no `{data, error}` envelope).\n- Errors use Problem Details only.\n\n**Data Exchange Formats:**\n- JSON fields are `camelCase`.\n- Date/time values are ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 UTC strings with `Z` suffix only.\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**Event Naming (if applicable):**\n- `event_name` is lowercase, dot-separated (e.g., `tenant.resolve_failed`).\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Use RFC 7807 Problem Details with fixed fields: `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `instance`.\n- Extensions: `invariant_code`, `trace_id`, `tenant_id` (if safe), and `errors` for validation.\n- `type` is stable and machine-meaningful (URN or URL).\n- `detail` must never leak internals or secrets.\n- For 500s, use generic title/detail with `trace_id` + `invariant_code`.\n- HTTP mapping discipline: 401/403 auth, 404 not found, 409 conflict, 422 semantic validation (if used), 429 rate limit, 500+ server faults.\n- For validation, use `ValidationProblemDetails` and include `invariant_code`.\n\n**Logging Patterns:**\n- Structured logs with a tight, consistent field set.\n- Required fields: `tenant_id`, `trace_id`, `request_id`, `invariant_code`, `event_name`, `severity`.\n- Optional fields: `span_id`, `user_id`, `route`, `endpoint`, `http_method`, `status_code`, `duration_ms`, `client_id`.\n- Prefer `invariant_code` (string) over GUID-like IDs.\n- Provide a minimal log enricher helper (e.g., `TenantLogEnricher`) and/or middleware.\n- Do not hard-depend on a specific logging stack beyond `ILogger`.\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Use explicit route parameters (e.g., `{tenantId}`) and plural endpoints.\n- Emit Problem Details for all errors with `invariant_code`.\n- Log required fields on every request-related log line.\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- Contract tests validate error shape, required log fields, and date/time formats.\n- Pattern violations are documented in the architecture decision doc and corrected in PRs.\n- Updates to patterns require updating this section and tests.\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- Route: `GET /tenants/{tenantId}`\n- Problem Details `type`: `urn:tenantfence:error:tenant-not-found`\n- Log: `event_name=tenant.resolve_failed`, `tenant_id=...`, `trace_id=...`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- Route: `/tenant/{id}` or `/Tenant`\n- Error envelope: `{ data, error }`\n- Dates: local time strings or missing `Z` suffix\n- Logs without `trace_id` or `invariant_code`\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete

in `TenantSaas.Sample/Auth` with API key handler.\n- Error boundary is enforced via Problem Details middleware.\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n- `TenantSaas.Abstractions` defines contracts and shared types only.\n- `TenantSaas.Core` implements enforcement, EF Core adapter, and logging helpers.\n- Contract tests target abstractions and core behavior; no sample coupling.\n\n**Service Boundaries:**\n- No internal services; the library remains a single trust-kernel.\n- Sample host is a thin integration example only.\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n- EF Core integration contained in `TenantSaas.Core/EfCore`.\n- Tenant context resolution is in `TenantSaas.Core/Tenancy`, accessed via abstractions.\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**FR Categories → Locations:**\n- Tenant context model → `TenantSaas.Abstractions/Tenancy` + `TenantSaas.Core/Tenancy`\n- Invariant enforcement/refusal → `TenantSaas.Core/Enforcement`\n- Integration point → `TenantSaas.Sample/Middleware` + `TenantSaas.Core/Tenancy`\n- Verification artifacts → `TenantSaas.ContractTests`\n- Trust contract/docs → `docs/`\n\n**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**\n- Error handling → `TenantSaas.Core/Errors` + `TenantSaas.Sample/Middleware`\n- Logging → `TenantSaas.Abstractions/Logging` + `TenantSaas.Core/Logging`\n- Break-glass → `TenantSaas.Core/Enforcement/BreakGlassPolicy.cs`\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal Communication:**\n- Sample host consumes `TenantSaas.Core` + `TenantSaas.Abstractions`.\n- Contract tests reference `TenantSaas.Core` and `TenantSaas.Abstractions`.\n\n**External Integrations:**\n- API key auth (sample only) is replaceable; BYO-auth stance in docs.\n\n**Data Flow:**\n- Request → API key auth → tenant context middleware → invariant guard → EF Core SaveChanges guard.\n\n### File Organization Patterns\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n- Root-level `Directory.Build.props/targets`, `global.json`, `.editorconfig`.\n- Sample config in `TenantSaas.Sample/appsettings*.json`.\n\n**Source Organization:**\n- Abstractions contain contracts only; Core contains all implementation.\n\n**Test Organization:**\n- Contract tests in `TenantSaas.ContractTests` only (no test subfolders).\n\n**Asset Organization:**\n- Docker assets under `docker/`.\n- Docs under `docs/`.\n\n### Development Workflow Integration\n\n**Development Server Structure:**\n- `dotnet run` from `TenantSaas.Sample` or Docker via `docker/sample.Dockerfile`.\n\n**Build Process Structure:**\n- Solution-wide build via `dotnet build TenantSaas.sln`.\n\n**Deployment Structure:**\n- Sample API containerized for demo; library shipped via NuGet (packaging deferred).\n\n## Architecture Validation Results\n\n### Coherence Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Compatibility:**\nAll technology choices are compatible: .NET 10 + EF Core 10, Minimal APIs, Problem Details, and Swashbuckle align without conflict.\n\n**Pattern

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Any other language-specific rules agents should follow?\"\n\n**Python/Ruby/Other Language Rules:**\nAdapt to the actual language in use with similar focused questions.\n\n### 3. Framework-Specific Rules\n\nDocument framework-specific patterns:\n\n**React Rules (if applicable):**\n\"For React development, I see these patterns:\n\n**Hooks Usage:**\n{{hooks_usage_patterns}}\n\n**Component Structure:**\n{{component_organization_rules}}\n\n**State Management:**\n{{state_management_patterns}}\n\n**Performance Rules:**\n{{performance_optimization_requirements}}\n\nShould I add any other React-specific rules?\"\n\n**Other Framework Rules:**\nAdapt for Vue, Angular, Next.js, Express, etc.\n\n### 4.

Generate Context Content\n\nFor each category, prepare lean content for the project context file:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n{{concise_technology_list_with_exact_versions}}\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Language-Specific Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_critical_language_rules}}\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_framework_patterns}}\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_testing_requirements}}\n\n### Code Quality & Style Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_style_and_quality_rules}}\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_workflow_patterns}}\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n{{bullet_points_of_anti_patterns_and_edge_cases}}\n```\n\n### 9. Present Content and Menu\n\nAfter each category, show the generated rules and present choices:\n\n\"I've drafted the {{category_name}} rules for your project context.\n\n**Here's what I'll add:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content for this category]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Explore nuanced rules for this category\n[P] Party Mode - Review from different implementation perspectives\n[C] Continue - Save these rules and move to next category\"\n\n### 10. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Execute advanced-elicitation.xml with current category rules\n- Process enhanced rules that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these enhanced rules for {{category}}? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Execute party-mode workflow with category rules context\n- Process collaborative insights on implementation patterns\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to {{category}} rules? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Save the current category content to project context file\n- Update frontmatter: `sections_completed: [...]`\n- Proceed to next category or step-03 if complete\n\n## APPEND TO PROJECT CONTEXT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C' for a category, append the content directly to `{output_folder}/project-context.md` using the structure from step 8.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ All critical technology versions accurately documented\n✅ Language-specific rules cover unobvious patterns\n✅ Framework rules capture project-specific conventions\n✅ Testing rules ensure consistent test quality\n✅ Code quality rules maintain project standards\n✅ Workflow rules prevent implementation conflicts\n✅ Content is lean and optimized for LLM context\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly for each category\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Including obvious rules that agents already know\n❌ Making content too verbose for LLM context efficiency\n❌ Missing critical anti-patterns or edge cases\n❌ Not getting user validation for each rule category\n❌ Not documenting exact versions and configurations\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter completing all rule categories and user selects 'C' for the final category, load `./step-03-complete.md` to finalize the project context file.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-03 until all categories are complete and user explicitly selects 'C' for each!\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
