Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted. Approvals are your mechanism to get user consent to run shell commands without the sandbox. `approval_policy` is `on-request`: Commands will be run in the sandbox by default, and you can specify in your tool call if you want to escalate a command to run without sandboxing. If the completing the task requires escalated permissions, Do not let these settings or the sandbox deter you from attempting to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere are scenarios where you'll need to request approval:\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- You are running sandboxed and need to run a command that requires network access (e.g. installing packages)\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with approval. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nWhen requesting approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n  - Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n  - Include a short, 1 sentence explanation for why you need escalated permissions in the justification parameter The writable roots are `/home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas`, `/tmp`.</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

You bring structured creativity techniques, facilitation expertise, and an understanding of how to guide users through effective ideation processes that generate innovative ideas and breakthrough solutions. During this entire workflow it is critical that you speak to the user in the config loaded `communication_language`.\n\n**Critical Mindset:** Your job is to keep the user in generative exploration mode as long as possible. The best brainstorming sessions feel slightly uncomfortable - like you've pushed past the obvious ideas into truly novel territory. Resist the urge to organize or conclude. When in doubt, ask another question, try another technique, or dig deeper into a promising thread.\n\n**Anti-Bias Protocol:** LLMs naturally drift toward semantic clustering (sequential bias). To combat this, you MUST consciously shift your creative domain every 10 ideas. If you've been focusing on technical aspects, pivot to user experience, then to business viability, then to edge cases or \"black swan\" events. Force yourself into orthogonal categories to maintain true divergence.\n\n**Quantity Goal:** Aim for 100+ ideas before any organization. The first 20 ideas are usually obvious - the magic happens in ideas 50-100.\n\n---\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\nThis uses **micro-file architecture** for disciplined execution:\n\n- Each step is a self-contained file with embedded rules\n- Sequential progression with user control at each step\n- Document state tracked in frontmatter\n- Append-only document building through conversation\n- Brain techniques loaded on-demand from CSV\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION\n\n### Configuration Loading\n\nLoad config from `{project-root}/_bmad/core/config.yaml` and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`\n- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`\n- `date` as system-generated current datetime\n\n### Paths\n\n- `installed_path` = `{project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/brainstorming`\n- `template_path` = `{installed_path}/template.md`\n- `brain_techniques_path` = `{installed_path}/brain-methods.csv`\n- `default_output_file` = `{output_folder}/analysis/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md`\n- `context_file` = Optional context file path from workflow invocation for project-specific guidance\n- `advancedElicitationTask` = `{project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml`\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTION\n\nLoad and execute `steps/step-01-session-setup.md` to begin the workflow.\n\n**Note:** Session setup, technique discovery, and continuation detection happen in step-01-session-setup.md.\n"}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Check for Existing Workflow\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n- Look for file at `{output_folder}/analysis/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n- **STOP here** and load `./step-01b-continue.md` immediately\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle the continuation logic\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Initialize Document\n\nCreate the brainstorming session document:\n\n```bash\n# Create directory if needed\nmkdir -p \"$(dirname \"{output_folder}/analysis/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md\")\"\n\n# Initialize from template\ncp \"{template_path}\" \"{output_folder}/analysis/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md\"\n```\n\n#### B. Context File Check and Loading\n\n**Check for Context File:**\n\n- Check if `context_file` is provided in workflow invocation\n- If context file exists and is readable, load it\n- Parse context content for project-specific guidance\n- Use context to inform session setup and approach recommendations\n\n#### C. Session Context Gathering\n\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I'm excited to facilitate your brainstorming session. I'll guide you through proven creativity techniques to generate innovative ideas and breakthrough solutions.\n\n**Context Loading:** [If context_file provided, indicate context is loaded]\n**Context-Based Guidance:** [If context available, briefly mention focus areas]\n\n**Let's set up your session for maximum creativity and productivity:**\n\n**Session Discovery Questions:**\n\n1. **What are we brainstorming about?** (The central topic or challenge)\n2. **What specific outcomes are you hoping for?** (Types of ideas, solutions, or insights)\"\n\n#### D. Process User Responses\n\nWait for user responses, then:\n\n**Session Analysis:**\n\"Based on your responses, I understand we're focusing on **[summarized topic]** with goals around **[summarized objectives]**.\n\n**Session Parameters:**\n\n- **Topic Focus:** [Clear topic articulation]\n- **Primary Goals:** [Specific outcome objectives]\n\n**Does this accurately capture what you want to achieve?**\"\n\n#### E.

Continue to Technique Selection\n\n\"**Session setup complete!** I have a clear understanding of your goals and can select the perfect techniques for your brainstorming needs.\n\n**Ready to explore technique approaches?**\n[1] User-Selected Techniques - Browse our complete technique library\n[2] AI-Recommended Techniques - Get customized suggestions based on your goals\n[3] Random Technique Selection - Discover unexpected creative methods\n[4] Progressive Technique Flow - Start broad, then systematically narrow focus\n\nWhich approach appeals to you most? (Enter 1-4)\"\n\n### 4. Handle User Selection and Initial Document Append\n\n#### When user selects approach number:\n\n- **Append initial session overview to `{output_folder}/analysis/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md`**\n- **Update frontmatter:** `stepsCompleted: [1]`, `selected_approach: '[selected approach]'`\n- **Load the appropriate step-02 file** based on selection\n\n### 5. Handle User Selection\n\nAfter user selects approach number:\n\n- **If 1:** Load `./step-02a-user-selected.md`\n- **If 2:** Load `./step-02b-ai-recommended.md`\n- **If 3:** Load `./step-02c-random-selection.md`\n- **If 4:** Load `./step-02d-progressive-flow.md`\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing workflow detected and continuation handled properly\n✅ Fresh workflow initialized with correct document structure\n✅ Session context gathered and understood clearly\n✅ User's approach selection captured and routed correctly\n✅ Frontmatter properly updated with session state\n✅ Document initialized with session overview section\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not checking for existing document before creating new one\n❌ Missing continuation detection leading to duplicate work\n❌ Insufficient session context gathering\n❌ Not properly routing user's approach selection\n❌ Frontmatter not updated with session parameters\n\n## SESSION SETUP PROTOCOLS:\n\n- Always verify document existence before initialization\n- Load brain techniques CSV only when needed for technique presentation\n- Use collaborative facilitation language throughout\n- Maintain psychological safety for creative exploration\n- Clear next-step routing based on user preferences\n\n## NEXT STEPS:\n\nBased on user's approach selection, load the appropriate step-02 file for technique selection and facilitation.\n\nRemember: Focus only on setup and routing - don't preload technique information or look ahead to execution steps!\n"}}

Initialize Technique with Coaching Frame\n\nSet up collaborative facilitation approach:\n\n\"**Outstanding! Let's begin our first technique with true collaborative facilitation.**\n\nI'm excited to facilitate **[Technique Name]** with you as a creative partner, not just a respondent. This isn't about me asking questions and you answering - this is about us exploring ideas together, building on each other's insights, and following the creative energy wherever it leads.\n\n**My Coaching Approach:**\n\n- I'll introduce one technique element at a time\n- We'll explore it together through back-and-forth dialogue\n- I'll build upon your ideas and help you develop them further\n- We'll dive deeper into concepts that spark your imagination\n- You can always say \"let's explore this more\" before moving on\n- **You're in control:** At any point, just say \"next technique\" or \"move on\" and we'll document current progress and start the next technique\n\n**Technique Loading: [Technique Name]**\n**Focus:** [Primary goal of this technique]\n**Energy:** [High/Reflective/Playful/etc.] based on technique type\n\n**Ready to dive into creative exploration together? Let's start with our first element!**\"\n\n### 2. Execute First Technique Element Interactively\n\nBegin with genuine facilitation of the first technique component:\n\n**For Creative Techniques (What If, Analogical, etc.):**\n\n\"**Let's start with: [First provocative question/concept]**\n\nI'm not just looking for a quick answer - I want to explore this together. What immediately comes to mind? Don't filter or edit - just share your initial thoughts, and we'll develop them together.\"\n\n**Wait for user response, then coach deeper:**\n\n- **If user gives basic response:** \"That's interesting! Tell me more about [specific aspect]. What would that look like in practice? How does that connect to your [session_topic]?\"\n- **If user gives detailed response:** \"Fascinating! I love how you [specific insight]. Let's build on that - what if we took that concept even further? How would [expand idea]?\"\n- **If user seems stuck:** \"No worries! Let me suggest a starting angle: [gentle prompt]. What do you think about that direction?\"\n\n**For Structured Techniques (SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, etc.):**\n\n\"**Let's explore [Specific letter/perspective]: [Prompt]**\n\nInstead of just listing possibilities, let's really dive into one promising direction. What's the most exciting or surprising thought you have about this?\"\n\n**Coach the exploration:**\n\n- \"That's a powerful idea! Help me understand the deeper implications...\"\n- \"I'm curious - how does this connect to what we discovered in [previous element]?\"\n- \"What would make this concept even more innovative or impactful?\"\n- \"Tell me more about [specific aspect the user mentioned]...\"\n\n### 3. Deep Dive Based on User Response\n\nFollow the user's creative energy with genuine coaching:\n\n**Responsive Facilitation Patterns:**\n\n**When user shares exciting idea:**\n\"That's brilliant! I can feel the creative energy there. Let's explore this more deeply:\n\n**Development Questions:**\n\n- What makes this idea so exciting to you?\n- How would this actually work in practice?\n- What are the most innovative aspects of this approach?\n- Could this be applied in unexpected ways?\n\n**Let me build on your idea:** [Extend concept with your own creative contribution]\"\n\n**When user seems uncertain:**\n\"Great starting point! Sometimes the most powerful ideas need space to develop. Let's try this angle:\n\n**Exploratory Questions:**\n\n- What if we removed all practical constraints?\n- How would [stakeholder] respond to this idea?\n- What's the most unexpected version of this concept?\n- Could we combine this with something completely different?\"\n\n**When user gives detailed response:**\n\"Wow, there's so much rich material here! I want to make sure we capture the full potential. Let me focus on what I'm hearing:\n\n**Key Insight:** [Extract and highlight their best point]\n**Building on That:** [Develop their idea further]\n**Additional Direction:** [Suggest new angles based on their thinking]\"\n\n### 4. Check Technique Continuation\n\nBefore moving to next technique element:\n\n**Check Engagement and Interest:**\n\n\"This has been incredibly productive! We've generated some fantastic ideas around [current element].\n\n**Before we move to the next technique element, I want to check in with you:**\n\n- Are there aspects of [current element] you'd like to explore further?\n- Are there ideas that came up that you want to develop more deeply?\n- Do you feel ready to move to the next technique element, or should we continue here?\n\n**Your creative energy is my guide - what would be most valuable right now?**\n\n**Options:**\n\n- **Continue exploring** current technique element\n- **Move to next technique element**\n- **Take a different angle** on current element\n- **Jump to most exciting idea** we've discovered so far\n\n**Remember:** At any time, just say **\"next technique\"** or **\"move on\"** and I'll immediately document our current progress and start the next technique!\"\n\n### 4.1. Energy Checkpoint (After Every 4-5 Exchanges)\n\n**Periodic Check-In (DO NOT skip this):**\n\n\"We've generated [X] ideas so far - great momentum!\n\n**Quick energy check:**\n\n- Want to **keep pushing** on this angle?\n- **Switch techniques** for a fresh perspective?\n- Or are you feeling like we've **thoroughly explored** this space?\n\nRemember: The goal is quantity first - we can organize later. What feels right?\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Default to continuing exploration.

Any insights you want to make sure we carry forward?**\n\n**What would you like to do next?**\n\n[K] **Keep exploring this technique** - We're just getting warmed up!\n[T] **Try a different technique** - Fresh perspective on the same topic\n[A] **Go deeper on a specific idea** - Develop a promising concept further (Advanced Elicitation)\n[B] **Take a quick break** - Pause and return with fresh energy\n[C] **Move to organization** - Only when you feel we've thoroughly explored\n\n**Default recommendation:** Unless you feel we've generated at least 100+ ideas, I suggest we keep exploring! The best insights often come after the obvious ideas are exhausted.\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'C' (Move to organization):\n\n- **Append the technique execution content to `{output_folder}/analysis/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md`**\n- **Update frontmatter:** `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`\n- **Load:** `./step-04-idea-organization.md`\n\n#### If 'K', 'T', 'A', or 'B' (Continue Exploring):\n\n- **Stay in Step 3** and restart the facilitation loop for the chosen path (or pause if break requested).\n- For option A, invoke Advanced Elicitation: `{advancedElicitationTask}`\n\n### 9. Update Documentation\n\nUpdate frontmatter and document with interactive session insights:\n\n**Update frontmatter:**\n\n```yaml\n---\nstepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]\ntechniques_used: [completed techniques]\nideas_generated: [total count]\ntechnique_execution_complete: true\nfacilitation_notes: [key insights about user's creative process]\n---\n```\n\n**Append to document:**\n\n```markdown\n## Technique Execution Results\n\n**[Technique 1 Name]:**\n\n- **Interactive Focus:** [Main exploration directions]\n- **Key Breakthroughs:** [Major insights from coaching dialogue]\n\n- **User Creative Strengths:** [What user demonstrated]\n- **Energy Level:** [Observation about engagement]\n\n**[Technique 2 Name]:**\n\n- **Building on Previous:** [How techniques connected]\n- **New Insights:** [Fresh discoveries]\n- **Developed Ideas:** [Concepts that evolved through coaching]\n\n**Overall Creative Journey:** [Summary of facilitation experience and outcomes]\n\n### Creative Facilitation Narrative\n\n_[Short narrative describing the user and AI collaboration journey - what made this session special, breakthrough moments, and how the creative partnership unfolded]_\n\n### Session Highlights\n\n**User Creative Strengths:** [What the user demonstrated during techniques]\n**AI Facilitation Approach:** [How coaching adapted to user's style]\n**Breakthrough Moments:** [Specific creative breakthroughs that occurred]\n**Energy Flow:** [Description of creative momentum and engagement]\n```\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to `{output_folder}/analysis/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md` using the structure from above.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Minimum 100 ideas generated before organization is offered\n✅ User explicitly confirms readiness to conclude (not AI-initiated)\n✅ Multiple technique exploration encouraged over single-technique completion\n✅ True back-and-forth facilitation rather than question-answer format\n✅ User's creative energy and interests guide technique direction\n✅ Deep exploration of promising ideas before moving on\n✅ Continuation checks allow user control of technique pacing\n✅ Ideas developed organically through collaborative coaching\n✅ User engagement and strengths recognized and built upon\n✅ Documentation captures both ideas and facilitation insights\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Offering organization after only one technique or <20 ideas\n❌ AI initiating conclusion without user explicitly requesting it\n❌ Treating technique completion as session completion signal\n❌ Rushing to document rather than staying in generative mode\n❌ Rushing through technique elements without user engagement\n❌ Not following user's creative energy and interests\n❌ Missing opportunities to develop promising ideas deeper\n❌ Not checking for continuation interest before moving on\n❌ Treating facilitation as script delivery rather than coaching\n\n## INTERACTIVE FACILITATION PROTOCOLS:\n\n- Present one technique element at a time for depth over breadth\n- Build upon user's ideas with genuine creative contributions\n- Follow user's energy and interests within technique structure\n- Always check for continuation interest before technique progression\n- Document both the \"what\" (ideas) and \"how\" (facilitation process)\n- Adapt coaching style based on user's creative preferences\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter technique completion and user confirmation, load `./step-04-idea-organization.md` to organize all the collaboratively developed ideas and create actionable next steps.\n\nRemember: This is creative coaching, not technique delivery! The user's creative energy is your guide, not the technique structure.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

certain operations require an additional confirmation step (not UI confirmation—an API-level “acknowledge risk” token).\n\nScaffold adaptation:\n\nPrivileged APIs require a Justification object (reason + ticket id + target set).\n\nOptionally, require a short-lived “elevation token” minted by a gate (makes it hard to casually call privileged methods in normal code paths).\n\n8) Formal methods mindset → “Invariants as executable assertions”\n\nSource: TLA+/design-by-contract, runtime assertions in safety-critical systems.\n\nWhat it buys you: the team reasons in invariants, not scattered rules; regressions are caught.\n\nScope mapping:\n\nEach scope has a defined invariant set (what cannot happen).\n\nThe enforcement layer asserts these invariants.\n\nScaffold adaptation:\n\nAn “invariant catalog” tied to scope:\n\n“Tenant scope cannot enumerate tenants.”\n\n“Reporting scope cannot write.”\n\n“Host scope cannot touch tenant tables.”\n\nContract tests that validate the catalog at integration points.\n\n9) Data governance models → “PII boundaries as a first-class operation”\n\nSource: GDPR/SOC2 practices, data classification.\n\nWhat it buys you: prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data in cross-tenant analytics and support tooling.\n\nScope mapping:\n\nReporting scope defaults to non-PII.\n\nSupport delegated scope may access PII, but only within a tenant and always auditable.\n\nAdmin scope can access PII only with justification and strict logging.\n\nScaffold adaptation:\n\nMake “Access PII” an explicit capability in the matrix.\n\nProvide patterns: separate read models (PII vs non-PII) or separate DbContexts for reporting.\n\nThe strongest adaptations for TenantSaaS v1 positioning\n\nIf you want to keep the baseline minimal but differentiated, the best 3 to adapt first are:\n\nKubernetes RBAC mapping (because it naturally models tenant namespaces vs host control plane)\n\nLedger/evidence events for scope transitions (because it operationalizes trust and compliance early)\n\nFormal-methods mindset via contract tests (because it makes guarantees provable)\n\nTogether, they map directly onto your scope-invariant model and create a unique identity: not “a starter kit,” but a trust-focused platform baseline.","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

When you apply Put to Other Uses to TenantSaaS, the surprising result is that it stops looking like a “starter” and starts looking like a trust substrate—something that multiple disciplines can lean on for different reasons.\n\nBelow are the most meaningful secondary and unexpected uses, mapped back to the scope–invariant model you’ve defined.\n\n1. Internal platform governance (beyond SaaS)\n\nUse: An internal platform for teams building multi-org or multi-customer systems inside a company.\n\nWhy it fits:\nLarge organizations routinely build “internal SaaS” (shared services used by many teams or business units). The same risks exist: data leakage, ambiguous ownership, overpowered admins.\n\nValue added:\nTenantSaaS becomes a governance layer that enforces:\n\nwhich team owns which data,\n\nwho can cross boundaries,\n\nhow privilege escalation is performed and reviewed.\n\nReframe:\nNot “multi-tenant SaaS,” but multi-domain system safety.\n\n2. Compliance evidence generator (SOC2, ISO, GDPR)\n\nUse: A source of machine-generated evidence for audits and compliance reviews.\n\nWhy it fits:\nAuditors don’t want explanations; they want proof that controls exist and are enforced. Your scope transitions, audit events, and invariants are already structured evidence.\n\nValue added:\n\n“Here is the code that enforces isolation.”\n\n“Here are immutable records of every privileged transition.”\n\n“Here are tests proving the invariant holds.”\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS acts as a compliance primitive, not just an architectural one.\n\n3. Migration safety net (monolith → SaaS, SaaS → enterprise)\n\nUse: Guardrails during high-risk refactors and migrations.\n\nWhy it fits:\nMigrations are when invariants break silently. Developers are touching many code paths at once, often without full context.\n\nValue added:\nTenantSaaS turns migrations into a fail-fast process:\n\nIf a new path forgets tenant scope, it explodes early.\n\nIf data crosses boundaries accidentally, it’s caught immediately.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS becomes a regression firewall for architectural change.\n\n4. On-call incident response and forensics\n\nUse: A tool for understanding and resolving production incidents safely.\n\nWhy it fits:\nWhen something goes wrong, teams need to:\n\ninspect data,\n\nrepair inconsistencies,\n\ndo so without making things worse.\n\nYour explicit admin/support scopes and evidence events are exactly what on-call work needs.\n\nValue added:\n\nClear visibility into who crossed tenant boundaries and why.\n\nReduced fear of “fixing one customer and breaking another.”\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS as operational safety gear, not just scaffolding.\n\n5. Acquisition and due diligence accelerator\n\nUse: Demonstrating architectural maturity to acquirers or investors.\n\nWhy it fits:\nDuring due diligence, “how do you prevent customer data leaks?” is a red-flag question. Most teams answer with narratives and diagrams.\n\nValue added:\nTenantSaaS lets you answer with:\n\nexplicit invariants,\n\nenforcement code,\n\naudit trails,\n\ntest results.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS becomes a trust artifact that reduces perceived technical risk.\n\n6. Developer onboarding and cultural imprinting\n\nUse: Teaching new developers how the system thinks about trust.\n\nWhy it fits:\nMost onboarding relies on tribal knowledge: “be careful with tenant stuff.” Your scope calculus makes trust boundaries concrete and enforced.\n\nValue added:\n\nNew developers learn the correct mental model by experiencing failures early.\n\nThe architecture teaches itself through constraints.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS as a culture-shaping tool, not just infrastructure.\n\n7. Security posture hardening (zero-trust at the application layer)\n\nUse: Strengthening application-layer security without a full security framework.\n\nWhy it fits:\nZero-trust principles usually stop at auth and networking. Your scope model extends them into data mutation and governance.\n\nValue added:\n\nNo implicit trust in ambient context.\n\nExplicit, reviewable capability elevation.\n\nClear blast-radius boundaries.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS as application-level zero trust.\n\n8. Safe foundation for automation and AI agents\n\nUse: Constraining automated systems (jobs, scripts, AI agents) that operate across tenants.\n\nWhy it fits:\nAutomation is indifferent to trust unless you encode it. Agents are especially dangerous without hard boundaries.\n\nValue added:\n\nAgents must declare scope.\n\nAgents cannot silently escalate privileges.\n\nAgent actions are attributable and auditable.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS as agent containment infrastructure.\n\n9. Customer-facing trust signals\n\nUse: Supporting claims like “we cannot access your data without explicit authorization.”\n\nWhy it fits:\nTrust is a differentiator, especially for B2B SaaS.

{"timestamp":"2026-01-23T20:20:32.719Z","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"user_message","message":"This is where the model proves whether it’s fundamental or merely convenient. When you apply Put to Other Uses to TenantSaaS, the surprising result is that it stops looking like a “starter” and starts looking like a trust substrate—something that multiple disciplines can lean on for different reasons.\n\nBelow are the most meaningful secondary and unexpected uses, mapped back to the scope–invariant model you’ve defined.\n\n1. Internal platform governance (beyond SaaS)\n\nUse: An internal platform for teams building multi-org or multi-customer systems inside a company.\n\nWhy it fits:\nLarge organizations routinely build “internal SaaS” (shared services used by many teams or business units). The same risks exist: data leakage, ambiguous ownership, overpowered admins.\n\nValue added:\nTenantSaaS becomes a governance layer that enforces:\n\nwhich team owns which data,\n\nwho can cross boundaries,\n\nhow privilege escalation is performed and reviewed.\n\nReframe:\nNot “multi-tenant SaaS,” but multi-domain system safety.\n\n2. Compliance evidence generator (SOC2, ISO, GDPR)\n\nUse: A source of machine-generated evidence for audits and compliance reviews.\n\nWhy it fits:\nAuditors don’t want explanations; they want proof that controls exist and are enforced. Your scope transitions, audit events, and invariants are already structured evidence.\n\nValue added:\n\n“Here is the code that enforces isolation.”\n\n“Here are immutable records of every privileged transition.”\n\n“Here are tests proving the invariant holds.”\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS acts as a compliance primitive, not just an architectural one.\n\n3. Migration safety net (monolith → SaaS, SaaS → enterprise)\n\nUse: Guardrails during high-risk refactors and migrations.\n\nWhy it fits:\nMigrations are when invariants break silently. Developers are touching many code paths at once, often without full context.\n\nValue added:\nTenantSaaS turns migrations into a fail-fast process:\n\nIf a new path forgets tenant scope, it explodes early.\n\nIf data crosses boundaries accidentally, it’s caught immediately.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS becomes a regression firewall for architectural change.\n\n4. On-call incident response and forensics\n\nUse: A tool for understanding and resolving production incidents safely.\n\nWhy it fits:\nWhen something goes wrong, teams need to:\n\ninspect data,\n\nrepair inconsistencies,\n\ndo so without making things worse.\n\nYour explicit admin/support scopes and evidence events are exactly what on-call work needs.\n\nValue added:\n\nClear visibility into who crossed tenant boundaries and why.\n\nReduced fear of “fixing one customer and breaking another.”\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS as operational safety gear, not just scaffolding.\n\n5. Acquisition and due diligence accelerator\n\nUse: Demonstrating architectural maturity to acquirers or investors.\n\nWhy it fits:\nDuring due diligence, “how do you prevent customer data leaks?” is a red-flag question. Most teams answer with narratives and diagrams.\n\nValue added:\nTenantSaaS lets you answer with:\n\nexplicit invariants,\n\nenforcement code,\n\naudit trails,\n\ntest results.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS becomes a trust artifact that reduces perceived technical risk.\n\n6. Developer onboarding and cultural imprinting\n\nUse: Teaching new developers how the system thinks about trust.\n\nWhy it fits:\nMost onboarding relies on tribal knowledge: “be careful with tenant stuff.” Your scope calculus makes trust boundaries concrete and enforced.\n\nValue added:\n\nNew developers learn the correct mental model by experiencing failures early.\n\nThe architecture teaches itself through constraints.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS as a culture-shaping tool, not just infrastructure.\n\n7. Security posture hardening (zero-trust at the application layer)\n\nUse: Strengthening application-layer security without a full security framework.\n\nWhy it fits:\nZero-trust principles usually stop at auth and networking. Your scope model extends them into data mutation and governance.\n\nValue added:\n\nNo implicit trust in ambient context.\n\nExplicit, reviewable capability elevation.\n\nClear blast-radius boundaries.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS as application-level zero trust.\n\n8. Safe foundation for automation and AI agents\n\nUse: Constraining automated systems (jobs, scripts, AI agents) that operate across tenants.\n\nWhy it fits:\nAutomation is indifferent to trust unless you encode it. Agents are especially dangerous without hard boundaries.\n\nValue added:\n\nAgents must declare scope.\n\nAgents cannot silently escalate privileges.\n\nAgent actions are attributable and auditable.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS as agent containment infrastructure.\n\n9. Customer-facing trust signals\n\nUse: Supporting claims like “we cannot access your data without explicit authorization.”\n\nWhy it fits:\nTrust is a differentiator, especially for B2B SaaS. Most claims are aspirational; yours can be architectural.\n\nValue added:\n\nYou can describe controls truthfully.\n\nYou can show how support access is bounded and logged.\n\nYou can align marketing claims with enforceable behavior.\n\nReframe:\nTenantSaaS as truthful trust marketing, backed by code.\n\nThe meta-insight\n\nWhen you apply P seriously, TenantSaaS stops being:\n\n“a scaffold to get started”\n\nand becomes:\n\na system that encodes and preserves trust across the entire lifecycle of a product.\n\nThat’s why skipping M was the right call. You’re not polishing a tool; you’re discovering its true domain.\n\nAt this point, TenantSaaS is no longer just for greenfield projects. It is relevant to:\n\nexisting systems,\n\nregulated environments,\n\ninternal platforms,\n\noperational teams,\n\nand even corporate transactions.","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

(file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

On day one, there are only two ideas that matter. First: every write happens inside a tenant scope, or it fails. Second: if the system isn’t sure which tenant you mean, it stops you immediately. That’s it. You don’t need to think about host scope, admin scope, reporting, or any of the formal machinery yet. Those exist to protect you later, not to slow you down now.\n\nWhen you write your first endpoint, the only thing that forces you into safety is that you must establish a tenant context before touching tenant data. In practice, that’s one explicit step early in the request or job: “I am operating as tenant X.” Once that’s done, you write normal business code.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/vlad/Source/TenantSaas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).
